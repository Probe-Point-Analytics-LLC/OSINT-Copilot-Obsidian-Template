using *all* database data, web‑search results, and the AI_Tool output.  \nNo tool errors occurred.\n\n====================================================\nOSINT DUE DILIGENCE REPORT  \nSubject: **Wagner Group** (incl. aliases and connected structures)  \nType: **Private Military Company / Transnational Criminal Organization**  \n====================================================\n\nSECTION 1 — IDENTITY & GENERAL BACKGROUND  \n----------------------------------------------------\nThe subject is known under a wide array of names and aliases (over 50), including: Wagner Group, PMC Wagner, ChVK Vagner, Groupe Wagner, Vagner Group, Africa Corps, Expeditionary Corps, League/Liga, and numerous translations in Cyrillic, European, and Asian languages.  \nThis high number of aliases indicates intentional obfuscation and operational compartmentalization.\n\nNo confirmed corporate registration numbers or tax identifiers have been found in any jurisdiction.  \nAddresses associated with the entity appear symbolic, abandoned, or connected to related Russian defense contractors.\n\nKnown addresses:\n• Delaware, USA (unverified — likely false/obfuscation)  \n• Pardubická 53352 Srch, Czech

providing plausible deniability for foreign military operations.\n\nBiographical context:\n• Founded around 2014.  \n• Led by Yevgeny Prigozhin until his death in 2023.  \n• Subsequent leadership reportedly transferred to his son, Pavel Prigozhin.  \n• Official rebranding to “Africa Corps” and “Russian Expeditionary Corps” began in 2023–2024 under direct Russian MoD control.\n\nActivities:  \n• Involved in Ukraine (Crimea 2014, Donbas, Bakhmut 2023), Syria, Libya, CAR, Mali, Sudan, Mozambique, and other African and Middle Eastern regions.  \n• Documented involvement in war crimes and human rights abuses.  \n• Engaged in resource extraction (gold, diamonds), political interference, and training of foreign forces.\n\nSources:  \nhttps://open_sanctions.example.com

status:  \n• “No direct PEP status” for the organization, but extremely politically exposed due to:  \n  - close ties to Russian state security apparatus  \n  - operations on behalf of Russian

crimes.\n\n3. **State proxy operations**  \n   Entity serves as an unofficial extension of Russian military activity.\n\n4. **Identity obfuscation**  \n   Use of 50+ aliases, numerous disconnected addresses, and rebranding.\n\n5. **Terrorist/extremist affiliations**  \n   Subunits linked to far-right extremist ideologies (e.g., Rusich).\n\nSources:  \nEU OJ links  \nOFAC releases

\n\n----------------------------------------------------\nSECTION 8 — CONCLUSION  \n----------------------------------------------------\nThe Wagner Group is one of the highest‑risk entities globally.

Any form of engagement, directly or indirectly, poses severe regulatory, financial, and legal consequences.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\nSECTION 9 — SUGGESTIONS (AI_Tool‑GENERATED)  \n----------------------------------------------------\nEntities recommended for deeper investigation:\n\nPersons:  \n• Yevgeny Prigozhin  \n• Pavel Prigozhin  \n• Vladimir Putin  \n\nCompanies:  \n• Africa Corps  \n• Additional Russian MoD-linked logistics companies supporting Wagner operations  \n\n(This list originated from the AI_Tool output and is compliant with instructions.)\n\n====================================================\n\nIf you need an expanded network map, enhanced relationship graph, or a full sanctions-matching compliance report, I can generate that too.\n\n🏷️ **Entities Created (18):**\n**Relationships Created:** 21",
