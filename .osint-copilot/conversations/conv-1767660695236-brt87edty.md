using *all* database data, web‑search results, and the AI_Tool output.  \nNo tool errors occurred.\n\n====================================================\nOSINT DUE DILIGENCE REPORT  \nSubject:

1 — IDENTITY & GENERAL BACKGROUND  \n----------------------------------------------------\nThe subject is known under a wide array of names and aliases (over 50), including: Wagner Group, PMC Wagner, ChVK Vagner, Groupe Wagner, Vagner Group, Africa Corps, Expeditionary Corps, League/Liga, and numerous translations in Cyrillic, European, and Asian languages.  \nThis high number of aliases indicates intentional obfuscation and operational compartmentalization.\n\nNo confirmed corporate registration numbers or tax identifiers have been found in any jurisdiction.  \nAddresses associated with the entity appear symbolic, abandoned, or connected to related Russian defense contractors.\n\nKnown addresses:\n• Delaware, USA (unverified — likely false/obfuscation)  \n• Pardubická 53352 Srch, Czech Republic  \n• 15 Zolnaya Street, Saint Petersburg, 195213, Russia  \n• 3A Zastavskaya Street, Saint Petersburg, Russia  \n\nJurisdictions appearing in data (not necessarily legal registrations):  \n• Russia, Czech Republic, Monaco, New Zealand, Switzerland, Canada, USA, UK, European Union  \n\nThe organization operates globally as a de facto **paramilitary extension of the Russian state**, providing plausible deniability for foreign military operations.\n\nBiographical context:\n• Founded around 2014.  \n• Led by Yevgeny Prigozhin until his death in 2023.  \n• Subsequent leadership reportedly transferred to his son, Pavel Prigozhin.  \n• Official rebranding to “Africa Corps” and “Russian Expeditionary Corps” began in 2023–2024 under direct Russian MoD control.\n\nActivities:  \n• Involved in Ukraine (Crimea 2014, Donbas, Bakhmut 2023), Syria, Libya, CAR, Mali, Sudan, Mozambique, and other African and Middle Eastern regions.  \n• Documented involvement in war crimes and human rights abuses.  \n• Engaged in resource extraction (gold, diamonds), political interference, and training of foreign forces.\n\nSources:  \nhttps://open_sanctions.example.com

\n\nSource:  \nopen_sanctions.example.com  \n\n----------------------------------------------------\nSECTION 3 — PEP & POLITICAL EXPOSURE  \n----------------------------------------------------\nPEP status:  \n• “No direct PEP status” for the organization, but extremely politically exposed due to:  \n  - close ties to Russian state security apparatus  \n  - operations on behalf of Russian geopolitical objectives  \n  - historical links to Kremlin via Prigozhin  \n\nSources:  \nopen_sanctions.example.com  \n\n----------------------------------------------------\nSECTION 4 — RELATED ENTITIES & NETWORKS  \n----------------------------------------------------\nFrom database + AI_Tool output:\n\nConnected entities:  \n• Africa Corps (rebranded structure post‑Wagner)  \n• Russian Expeditionary Corps (REK)  \n• Rusich (extremist neo‑Nazi subunit)  \n• Individuals:  \n  - Yevgeny Prigozhin  \n  - Pavel Prigozhin  \n  - Vladimir Putin (political linkage; not organizational member)\n\nRelationship types:  \n• Operational continuation (Africa Corps)  \n• State sponsorship (Russian MoD, Kremlin)  \n• Leadership (Prigozhin family)\n\nSources:  \nopen_sanctions.example.com  \nAI_Tool output  \n\n----------------------------------------------------\nSECTION 5 — ONLINE PRESENCE  \n----------------------------------------------------\nNone confirmed.  \nNo official, verifiable website or social media accounts.\n\nInterpretation:  \nHigh secrecy and disinformation environment, reliance on unofficial channels and Telegram networks.\n\nSources:  \nNone (explicitly empty)  \n\n----------------------------------------------------\nSECTION 6 — RISKS ASSESSMENT  \n----------------------------------------------------\nMajor risks identified:\n\n1. **Extremely high sanctions exposure**  \n   Multiple jurisdictions globally — severe legal, financial, and reputational risk.\n\n2. **Human rights violations**  \n   Documented executions, torture, resource theft, war crimes.\n\n3. **State proxy operations**  \n   Entity serves as an unofficial extension of Russian military activity.\n\n4. **Identity obfuscation**  \n   Use of 50+ aliases, numerous disconnected addresses, and rebranding.\n\n5. **Terrorist/extremist affiliations**  \n   Subunits linked to far-right extremist ideologies (e.g., Rusich).\n\nSources:  \nEU OJ links  \nOFAC releases  \nopen_sanctions.example.com  \n\n----------------------------------------------------\nSECTION 7 — MEDIA SUMMARY  \n----------------------------------------------------\nPublic reporting highlights:  \n• Withdrawal from Mali due to casualties (AP News)  \n• Rebranding to Africa Corps for strategic continuity (Le Monde)  \n• Post-Prigozhin leadership transition to Pavel Prigozhin  \n• Operational role in Bakhmut described as “meat‑grinder tactics”  \n• Wagner used for resource extraction (gold, diamonds) in Africa  \n\nSources:  \nAP News  \nLe Monde  \nWikipedia  \n\n----------------------------------------------------\nSECTION 8 — CONCLUSION  \n----------------------------------------------------\nThe Wagner Group is one of the highest‑risk entities globally. It is sanctioned by nearly every Western-aligned jurisdiction, involved in armed conflicts, human rights abuses, and politically sensitive operations. Any form of engagement, directly or indirectly, poses severe regulatory, financial, and legal consequences.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\nSECTION 9 — SUGGESTIONS (AI_Tool‑GENERATED)  \n----------------------------------------------------\nEntities recommended for deeper investigation:\n\nPersons:  \n• Yevgeny Prigozhin  \n• Pavel Prigozhin  \n• Vladimir Putin  \n\nCompanies:  \n• Africa Corps  \n• Additional Russian MoD-linked logistics companies supporting Wagner operations  \n\n(This list originated from the AI_Tool output and is compliant with instructions.)\n\n====================================================\n\nIf you need an expanded network map, enhanced relationship graph, or a full sanctions-matching compliance report, I can generate that too.\n\n🏷️ **Entities Created (18):**\n**Relationships Created:** 21",

status:  \n• “No direct PEP status” for the organization, but extremely politically exposed due to:  \n  - close ties to Russian state security apparatus  \n  - operations on behalf of Russian geopolitical objectives  \n  - historical links to Kremlin via Prigozhin  \n\nSources:  \nopen_sanctions.example.com  \n\n----------------------------------------------------\nSECTION 4 — RELATED ENTITIES & NETWORKS  \n----------------------------------------------------\nFrom database + AI_Tool output:\n\nConnected entities:  \n• Africa Corps (rebranded structure post‑Wagner)  \n• Russian Expeditionary Corps (REK)  \n• Rusich (extremist neo‑Nazi subunit)  \n• Individuals:  \n  - Yevgeny Prigozhin  \n  - Pavel Prigozhin  \n  - Vladimir Putin (political linkage; not organizational member)\n\nRelationship types:  \n• Operational continuation (Africa Corps)  \n• State sponsorship (Russian MoD, Kremlin)  \n• Leadership (Prigozhin family)\n\nSources:  \nopen_sanctions.example.com  \nAI_Tool output  \n\n----------------------------------------------------\nSECTION 5 — ONLINE PRESENCE  \n----------------------------------------------------\nNone confirmed.  \nNo official, verifiable website or social media accounts.\n\nInterpretation:  \nHigh secrecy and disinformation environment, reliance on unofficial channels and Telegram networks.\n\nSources:  \nNone (explicitly empty)  \n\n----------------------------------------------------\nSECTION 6 — RISKS ASSESSMENT  \n----------------------------------------------------\nMajor risks identified:\n\n1. **Extremely high sanctions exposure**  \n   Multiple jurisdictions globally — severe legal, financial, and reputational risk.\n\n2. **Human rights violations**  \n   Documented executions, torture, resource theft, war crimes.\n\n3. **State proxy operations**  \n   Entity serves as an unofficial extension of Russian military activity.\n\n4. **Identity obfuscation**  \n   Use of 50+ aliases, numerous disconnected addresses, and rebranding.\n\n5. **Terrorist/extremist affiliations**  \n   Subunits linked to far-right extremist ideologies (e.g., Rusich).\n\nSources:  \nEU OJ links  \nOFAC releases  \nopen_sanctions.example.com  \n\n----------------------------------------------------\nSECTION 7 — MEDIA SUMMARY  \n----------------------------------------------------\nPublic reporting highlights:  \n• Withdrawal from Mali due to casualties (AP News)  \n• Rebranding to Africa Corps for strategic continuity (Le Monde)  \n• Post-Prigozhin leadership transition to Pavel Prigozhin  \n• Operational role in Bakhmut described as “meat‑grinder tactics”  \n• Wagner used for resource extraction (gold, diamonds) in Africa  \n\nSources:  \nAP News  \nLe Monde  \nWikipedia  \n\n----------------------------------------------------\nSECTION 8 — CONCLUSION  \n----------------------------------------------------\nThe Wagner Group is one of the highest‑risk entities globally. It is sanctioned by nearly every Western-aligned jurisdiction, involved in armed conflicts, human rights abuses, and politically sensitive operations. Any form of engagement, directly or indirectly, poses severe regulatory, financial, and legal consequences.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\nSECTION 9 — SUGGESTIONS (AI_Tool‑GENERATED)  \n----------------------------------------------------\nEntities recommended for deeper investigation:\n\nPersons:  \n• Yevgeny Prigozhin  \n• Pavel Prigozhin  \n• Vladimir Putin  \n\nCompanies:  \n• Africa Corps  \n• Additional Russian MoD-linked logistics companies supporting Wagner operations  \n\n(This list originated from the AI_Tool output and is compliant with instructions.)\n\n====================================================\n\nIf you need an expanded network map, enhanced relationship graph, or a full sanctions-matching compliance report, I can generate that too.",

BitcoinMixer.eu support email: support@bitcoinmixer.eu (from listing text)\n  - BitcoinMixer.eu GPG public key mentioned (\"Download our GPG public key\")\n  - References to multilingual support (EN, Русский, etc.) indicating multi-regional targeting\n  - Several onion mirrors and directory references (common operational security for hidden services)\n  - Marketplace categories (carding, money transfers, hacking) — potential buyer demand for mixing proceeds\n\nKey Insights (3–5, evidence-based and actionable)\n\n1) Multiple custodial mixers advertise similar fee structures and operational parameters — likely centralized pooling\n- Evidence: Thormixer explicitly lists fees of 4–5%, mixing times 0–6 hours, and deposit minimums 0.003–0.005 BTC up to 50 BTC. BitcoinMixer.eu and other listings make similar claims (instant mixing, large liquidity claims).\n- Interpretation: These services appear to be custodial (you deposit BTC to their pool and they return \"clean\" BTC), not pure CoinJoin-style decentralized protocols. Short mixing windows and fixed percentage fees are consistent with custodial tumblers/refund pools.\n- Actionable: Custodial mixers concentrate funds and create a smaller set of destination clusters to monitor. If you can identify deposit addresses, you can follow outflows from the service pool to downstream clusters (exchanges, marketplaces). Prioritize collection of observable deposit addresses and timing metadata.\n\n2) Mixer operational footprint links to typical underground commerce ecosystem — high risk for illicit funds including ransomware and marketplace proceeds\n- Evidence: Mixer listings are present on Hidden Wiki, Amnesia, DarkSearch, and are cross-linked with marketplaces (Deep Market) and escrow services. Marketplace categories identified (carding, hacking, money transfers) are typical sources of illicit proceeds seeking mixing.\n- Interpretation: Mixers advertised here are integrated into the darkweb money-laundering ecosystem; funds from marketplaces or extortion often route to mixers. Monitoring these mixer's outputs can reveal relationships between criminal storefronts and cash-out points (exchanges, OTC, P2P sellers).\n- Actionable: Map transactions from suspected marketplace wallets through these mixers to identify cashout addresses and potential exchanges/OTC services receiving funds.\n\n3) Operational security indicators available in service pages can be exploited for attribution and measurement\n- Evidence: Thormixer advertises Telegram Bot, Tor mirrors, and \"NO LOGS\"; BitcoinMixer.eu advertises a GPG public key and support@ email; Escrow Inc. uses ProtonMail email (escrwinc@pm.me).\n- Interpretation: The presence of GPG keys, Telegram bot endpoints, and contact emails gives investigators additional metadata (PGP fingerprints, Telegram usernames, email headers if messages captured) to correlate accounts across services. ProtonMail short-addresses (pm.me) are often reused, and PGP keys can be compared across platforms for reuse.\n- Actionable: Collect GPG public keys and any Telegram handles or bot endpoints, then search for reuse of these artifacts in other onion pages and surface web mirrors. PGP fingerprints are high-confidence linkage artifacts.\n\n4) Fee levels and deposit minimums provide a practical way to triage transactions of interest\n- Evidence: Thormixer lists a minimum deposit ~0.003–0.005 BTC and fees 4–5%. Some mixers also advertise \"Complete Anonymity + Precise Payment\" which often means smaller change outputs or predetermined splitting behavior.\n- Interpretation: If you observe inbound transactions to suspected mixer cluster that match these amounts and time windows, you can increase confidence that funds went into a particular mixer. For example, multiple deposits just above 0.003 BTC followed by outputs within 0–6 hours could indicate Thormixer use.\n- Actionable: Construct detection rules in blockchain analytic tools to flag deposits matching these thresholds and temporal patterns for prioritized review.\n\n5) Directory and indexing pages (Amnesia, Hidden Wiki, DarkSearch) are fertile sources of operational metadata but also present deception risk\n- Evidence: Multiple mixers and escrow services are listed across Amnesia and Hidden Wiki; the Amnesia listing notes \"Tor mirror\" and alternate onion addresses; Ahmia warning about fake clones noted in Amnesia texts.\n- Interpretation: Operators often spin up mirror sites and clones to evade takedown and to phish users. Directory entries can be outdated or intentionally spoofed. Relying on directories without verifying site PGP/PGP can result in false attributions.\n- Actionable: Always validate service identity via GPG signatures, PGP/PGP keys on page, or PGP-signed canary / PGP key fingerprint comparisons across mirrors before treating a service's addresses as authoritative.\n\nSuggested Next Steps — investigative actions and search queries\n\nOperational collection and triage\n- Crawl and archive (WARC) the referenced onion pages to capture full HTML and any visible wallet deposit addresses, PGP keys, Telegram bot handles, or JavaScript endpoints. Preserve timestamps and Tor circuit metadata where possible.\n- Extract and normalize any Bitcoin addresses visible on pages or in forms. If pages do not display addresses until dynamic actions, emulate interaction in a controlled Tor environment (sandbox) to capture deposit addresses.\n- Configure blockchain analytics rules to flag:\n  - Incoming transactions matching deposits >=0.003 BTC and <=50 BTC that move within 0–6 hours to new addresses.\n  - Clusters that receive multiple inbound deposits matching the 4–5% fee pattern (i.e., observed difference between inbound and outbound circa fee).\n- Query list (Dark web)\n  - \"Thormixer\" onion address + PGP key\n  - \"Thormixer\" Telegram bot name\n  - \"Anonymixer\" onion + \"fee\" + \"mixing time\"\n  - \"BitcoinMixer.eu\" support@bitcoinmixer.eu + PGP fingerprint\n  - \"CryptoMix\" mixer listing + fee\n  - Search on Amnesia/Hidden Wiki/DarkSearch for same mixer names to find mirrors\n- Query list (Surface web / OSINT)\n  - \"Thormixer\" (in quotes) — check for any mirrors, paste sites, or law-enforcement reports\n  - \"support@bitcoinmixer.eu\" + \"PGP\" / \"key\" — look for posted fingerprints on clearnet\n  - \"escrwinc@pm.me\" — search paste sites, public leaks for reuse of ProtonMail address\n  - Check public blockchain explorers (e.g., mempool.space, blockchair) for clusters declared in known darkweb monitoring reports\n  - Search Paste sites and Telegram channels for mentions of these mixers and price complaints/withdrawal delays (may indicate exit scam)\n\nForensic / Legal follow-up\n- If you have specific suspect BTC addresses, produce transaction graphs and request exchange/transmission logs via legal process for any downstream exchange deposit addresses identified.\n- Preserve metadata and documentation for chain-of-custody: archived onion pages, screenshots, and raw HTML with timestamps.\n- If deposits are linked to criminal events (ransomware, theft), coordinate with relevant LE for subpoenas to exchanges receiving outputs.\n\nTechnical detection suggestions\n- Implement heuristics to detect custodial mixer behavior:\n  - Many-to-few clustering with rapid consolidation.\n  - Nearly identical outflow amounts minus a nearly-fixed percentage fee.\n  - Short time lag between inbound deposits and outgoing distribution (0–6 hours).\n- Combine on-chain heuristics with off-chain metadata (PGP keys, Telegram handles, onion mirrors) to create high-confidence indicators.\n\nAdditional investigative queries to run\n- \"site:amnesia7u5odx5xbwtpnqk3edybgud5bmiagu75bnqx2crntw5kry7ad.onion Thormixer\"\n- \"Thormixer fee 4% 5% 'Complete Anonymity' 'Telegram' \"\n- \"support@bitcoinmixer.eu 'GPG' OR 'PGP' key\"\n- \"escrwinc@pm.me 'Escrow Inc.'\"\n- \"trocador onion swap 'Trocador' 'swap coins privately'\"\n- Search across darkweb indexes for reuse of same PGP key, ProtonMail address, or Telegram account names to cluster operator infrastructure.\n\nNotes on limitations and risk\n- Many hidden services change onion addresses frequently; mirror pages and directory entries may be outdated or maliciously cloned. PGP fingerprints and signed statements are higher-confidence artifacts.\n- Dynamic content (JS forms that generate deposit addresses only after initiating a mix) may hide deposit addresses from static scraping; perform interactive collection carefully in an isolated environment.\n- This assessment is based on the provided raw text from onion listings and common blockchain-mixing behaviors. Confirm any transactional linkages with blockchain analysis on concrete addresses.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Parse and archive these onion pages and extract any Bitcoin addresses or PGP keys visible (requires safe Tor-sandboxed environment).\n- Produce example blockchain queries and graphing steps (for e.g., in Blockchair/Blockstream API or a Chainalysis-style approach) to trace likely flows through suspected mixer clusters.\n- Create YARA-like detection rules / regex patterns to detect deposit patterns matching Thormixer-style minimums/fees when scanning transaction feeds.\n\n",

If pages do not display addresses until dynamic actions, emulate interaction in a controlled Tor environment (sandbox) to capture deposit addresses.\nConfigure blockchain analytics rules to flag:\nIncoming transactions matching deposits >=0.003 BTC and <=50 BTC that move within 0–6 hours to new addresses.\nClusters that receive multiple inbound deposits matching the 4–5% fee pattern (i.e., observed difference between inbound and outbound circa fee).\nQuery list (Dark web)\n\"Thormixer\" onion address + PGP key\n\"Thormixer\" Telegram bot name\n\"Anonymixer\" onion + \"fee\" + \"mixing time\"\n\"BitcoinMixer.eu\" support@bitcoinmixer.eu + PGP fingerprint\n\"CryptoMix\" mixer listing + fee\nSearch on Amnesia/Hidden Wiki/DarkSearch for same mixer names to find mirrors\nQuery list (Surface web / OSINT)\n\"Thormixer\" (in quotes) — check for any mirrors, paste sites, or law-enforcement reports\n\"support@bitcoinmixer.eu\" + \"PGP\" / \"key\" — look for posted fingerprints on clearnet\n\"escrwinc@pm.me\" — search paste sites, public leaks for reuse of ProtonMail address\nCheck public blockchain explorers (e.g., mempool.space, blockchair) for clusters declared in known darkweb monitoring reports\nSearch Paste sites and Telegram channels for mentions of these mixers and price complaints/withdrawal delays (may indicate exit scam)\nForensic / Legal follow-up\n\nIf you have specific suspect BTC addresses, produce transaction graphs and request exchange/transmission logs via legal process for any downstream exchange deposit addresses identified.\nPreserve metadata and documentation for chain-of-custody: archived onion pages, screenshots, and raw HTML with timestamps.\nIf deposits are linked to criminal events (ransomware, theft), coordinate with relevant LE for subpoenas to exchanges receiving outputs.\nTechnical detection suggestions\n\nImplement heuristics to detect custodial mixer behavior:\nMany-to-few clustering with rapid consolidation.\nNearly identical outflow amounts minus a nearly-fixed percentage fee.\nShort time lag between inbound deposits and outgoing distribution (0–6 hours).\nCombine on-chain heuristics with off-chain metadata (PGP keys, Telegram handles, onion mirrors) to create high-confidence indicators.\nAdditional investigative queries to run\n\n\"site:amnesia7u5odx5xbwtpnqk3edybgud5bmiagu75bnqx2crntw5kry7ad.onion Thormixer\"\n\"Thormixer fee 4% 5% 'Complete Anonymity' 'Telegram' \"\n\"support@bitcoinmixer.eu 'GPG' OR 'PGP' key\"\n\"escrwinc@pm.me 'Escrow Inc.'\"\n\"trocador onion swap 'Trocador' 'swap coins privately'\"\nSearch across darkweb indexes for reuse of same PGP key, ProtonMail address, or Telegram account names to cluster operator infrastructure.\nNotes on limitations and risk\n\nMany hidden services change onion addresses frequently; mirror pages and directory entries may be outdated or maliciously cloned. PGP fingerprints and signed statements are higher-confidence artifacts.\nDynamic content (JS forms that generate deposit addresses only after initiating a mix) may hide deposit addresses from static scraping; perform interactive collection carefully in an isolated environment.\nThis assessment is based on the provided raw text from onion listings and common blockchain-mixing behaviors. Confirm any transactional linkages with blockchain analysis on concrete addresses.\nIf you want, I can:\n\nParse and archive these onion pages and extract any Bitcoin addresses or PGP keys visible (requires safe Tor-sandboxed environment).\nProduce example blockchain queries and graphing steps (for e.g., in Blockchair/Blockstream API or a Chainalysis-style approach) to trace likely flows through suspected mixer clusters.\nCreate YARA-like detection rules / regex patterns to detect deposit patterns matching Thormixer-style minimums/fees when scanning transaction feeds.",

Identity Collision Risk  \n• Russian-language scraped profiles present similar name (“Мухамадиев Адиc Ахметович”).  \n• Same ID number appears on aggregator site; likely a scraping artefact.  \n• No evidence the subject is connected to Russia or Russian registries.\n\n3. Reputation & Public Exposure  \n• Generally positive; no controversies found.  \n• Health-related media coverage but non-risk-related.\n\n4. Sanctions Risk  \n• No direct or indirect sanctions.  \n• Low risk.\n\nSource links:  \nAll links in previous sections.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 8 — MEDIA & PUBLIC INFORMATION  \n• Publicly covered due to health announcement (lymphoma remission).  \n• Media coverage mostly focuses on political activities and foreign policy commentary.  \n• No negative or controversial reporting found in sources provided.\n\nSource links:  \nhttps://www.klix.ba/vijesti/svijet/adis-ahmetovic-zastupnik-u-bundestagu-objavio-da-je-pobijedio-rak-limfnih-cvorova/241018159  \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adis_Ahmetovic  \n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 9 — SUMMARY CONCLUSION  \n• Verified identity: German-Bosnian politician, Bundestag member (SPD).  \n• No sanctions anywhere.  \n• Confirmed PEP.  \n• A likely erroneous Russian-language mirror profile may cause dataset collisions, but no indication of fraud or conflicting identity.  \n• No criminal, corruption, or legal issues identified.  \n• Risk level:  \n  - Political/PEP risk: Moderate (normal for role)  \n  - Sanctions risk: Low  \n  - Integrity risk: Low  \n  - Identity confusion risk: Moderate (due to scraper sites, but harmless)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSECTION 10 — SUGGESTIONS (AI_Tool-based)\n\nUsing the AI_Tool results, recommended persons and entities for deeper research:\n\n• Organizations:  \n  - SPD (Social Democratic Party of Germany)  \n  - SPD Hannover  \n  - Bundestag  \n  - Business Forum of the SPD  \n  - Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP)  \n  - DRK Schwesternschaft Clementinenhaus e.V.  \n  - Lower Saxon State Chancellery  \n  - Leibniz University Hannover  \n  - Herschelschule  \n\n• Suggested individuals for contextual mapping:  \n  - Senior SPD leadership  \n  - Other Bundestag members in the Foreign Affairs Committee  \n  - Board members of SWP and SPD Business Forum  \n\nThese could help build a broader network and risk map around the subject.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNo tool or node errors occurred; no “Errors & Warnings” section needed.\n\nIf you need an enhanced risk scoring model, cross-border mapping, link-chart network, or adverse-media deep scan, I can generate it.\n\n🏷️ **Entities Created (12):**\n**Relationships Created:** 12",

Связанные лица и структуры\n\nAI_Tool выделил следующие связанные сущности:  \nПерсоны:  \n• Сергей Николаевич Шуров  \n• Егор Сергеевич Суров  \n• Валерий Георгиевич Суров  \n• Серов, Сергей Николаевич  \n\nЮрлица/клубы (для футболиста):  \n• Локомотив  \n• Искра Смоленск  \n• Геолог Тюмень  \n• Рубин Казань  \n\nСвязи между политиком и этими лицами не подтверждены.  \n\nИсточники:  \n• AI_Tool вывод  \n• https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Суров,_Сергей_Михайлович  \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n7. Онлайн‑присутствие  \nДанные о соцсетях, сайтах, аккаунтах отсутствуют.  \n\nИсточники:  \n• https://aleph.example.com  \n• https://open_sanctions.example.com  \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n8. Риски\n\n8.1. Риск: PEP Exposure  \nЛицо является PEP. Требуется повышенная проверка источников дохода, происхождения активов, корпоративных связей.\n\n8.2. Риск: Sanctions Proximity  \nПоявление в OpenSanctions повышает общий риск‑уровень, но не является признаком реальных санкций.  \n\n8.3. Риск однородности ФИО  \nНесколько почти совпадающих ФИО (Серов, Суров, Шуров) увеличивает вероятность ошибок комплаенса (false match). Требуется уточнение параметров идентификации: дата рождения, регион, должность.  \n\nИсточники:  \n• https://open_sanctions.example.com  \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n9. Итоговая оценка\n\n• Серов (или Шуров) Сергей Николаевич — подтвержденный PEP, депутат Алтайского краевого законодательного собрания, не находящийся ни под какими международными санкциями.  \n• Биографии, подтвержденной по дате рождения, нет.  \n• Не обнаружено корпоративных связей, регистрационных данных, адресов или идентификаторов.  \n• Найден футболист с похожим именем, но он **не является** объектом рисков и умер в 2005 году.  \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n10. Suggestions (сгенерировано через AI_Tool)\n\nРекомендации, кого стоит проверить дополнительно:\n\n1. Егор Сергеевич Суров  \n(возможная родственная связь — уточнение могло бы исключить ошибки совпадений)\n\n2. Валерий Георгиевич Суров  \n(аналогично, совпадение фамилии требует проверки)\n\n3. Региональные структуры, связанные с АКЗС  \nНапример:  \n• бизнес‑контрагенты региональных депутатов  \n• компании, связанные с региональными госзакупками  \n\n4. Футбольные клубы, если требуется биографическое уточнение  \n(Локомотив, Искра Смоленск, Геолог Тюмень, Рубин Казань — только если проводится глубокий background‑screening фамилии в целом)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nОшибки и предупреждения  \nОшибок инструментов не обнаружено.",

The individual appears only in business‑registry–type datasets referencing a Russian tax identifier. No broader biographical footprint is detected.\n\nSources for this section:  \nhttps://example.com/source-for-inn  \nhttps://example.com/source-aleph  \n\n------------------------------------------------  \nSECTION 2 — Sanctions Screening (Very Detailed)  \n------------------------------------------------  \n\nIMPORTANT: A sanctions object appears in the data, but **OpenSanctions ID is null**, and the linked page appears to be a **business registry profile**, not a sanctions listing. The presence of the term *OpenSanctions* in metadata often indicates that the dataset was checked, not that the person is sanctioned.\n\nBelow is a detailed breakdown by sanctions lists and jurisdictions.\n\n=== 2.1 Russia (RU) Sanctions Lists ===  \nNo Russian sanctions (Rosfinmonitoring) entries identified.  \nNo entries in federal wanted lists or monitoring registries.\n\n=== 2.2 United States (OFAC) Lists ===  \nNo entry found.  \nNo matches in:  \n• SDN List  \n• SSI List  \n• CAPTA, NS-CMIC, FSE, or other OFAC programs  \n\n=== 2.3 European Union Sanctions (EU Council Regulations) ===  \nNo match found in EU restrictive measures databases.\n\n=== 2.4 United Kingdom Sanctions (UK HMT OFSI) ===  \nNo listing found.\n\n=== 2.5 United Nations (UN Security Council Lists) ===  \nNo match found.\n\n=== 2.6 Canada (SEMA), Australia, Switzerland, Japan ===  \nNo entries identified.\n\n=== 2.7 OpenSanctions Mention ===  \nThe databases contain a record labelled:  \n\"scheme\": \"OpenSanctions\"  \n…but with:  \n• id: null  \n• URL points to: https://ogrn.site/… (a corporate/individual registry aggregator)\n\nThis means:  \n• The dataset referencing OpenSanctions likely cross‑links identities to check against sanctions lists  \n• There is **no evidence** that the individual is actually listed on OpenSanctions  \n• The URL is **not** a sanctions entry  \n\nConclusion:  \n**No verified sanctions found in any jurisdiction.**  \nThe OpenSanctions reference is a *false positive* due to incomplete metadata.\n\nSources for this section:  \nhttps://ogrn.site/люди/4942362-суров_сергей_геннадьевич/  \nhttps://example.com/source-aleph  \n\n------------------------------------------------  \nSECTION 3 — PEP (Politically Exposed Person) Check  \n------------------------------------------------  \nResult:  \nNo PEP associations detected.\n\nDetails:  \n• No positions in government  \n• No political exposure data in API_Converter1 or web search  \n• No affiliation to political figures, state enterprises, or public offices\n\nSources:  \nAPI_Converter1 output (no PEP data)  \n\n------------------------------------------------  \nSECTION 4 — Corporate and Business Activity  \n------------------------------------------------  \nDatabases show:  \n• No companies associated  \n• No entrepreneurial registration  \n• No corporate roles or affiliations  \n• No OGRN, no legal form, no incorporation history  \n\nConclusion:  \nNo active or historical business activity identified.\n\nSources:  \nhttps://example.com/source-aleph  \nhttps://example.com/source-for-inn  \n\n------------------------------------------------  \nSECTION 5 — Online Presence & Media Footprint  \n------------------------------------------------  \nResults:  \n• No social media accounts found  \n• No online profiles  \n• No publication records  \n• No news articles or public media mentions  \n• Only one website referencing his name: a basic public registry aggregator (ogrn.site)\n\nConclusion:  \nExtremely low digital footprint.\n\nSources:  \nhttps://ogrn.site/люди/4942362-суров_сергей_геннадьевич/  \n\n------------------------------------------------  \nSECTION 6 — Risk Assessment  \n------------------------------------------------  \n\nIdentified potential risks:\n\n1. Presence of a sanctions object in the database  \n• Although the OpenSanctions ID is null, any mismatch or metadata anomaly creates possible compliance noise  \n• Requires manual verification  \n• Final assessment: low risk, likely a false positive\n\n2. Very limited biographical data  \n• Missing date of birth, address, professional background  \n• Low transparency can be a risk factor in due diligence contexts\n\nNo additional risks (fraud, legal cases, political exposure, corporate links) identified.\n\nSources:  \nhttps://example.com/source-for-inn  \nhttps://example.com/source-aleph  \nhttps://ogrn.site/...  \n\n------------------------------------------------  \nSECTION 7 — Overall Assessment  \n------------------------------------------------  \nBased on all available data:\n\n• No sanctions found  \n• No political exposure  \n• No corporate affiliations  \n• No media or reputational concerns identified  \n• The digital identity is minimal, making verification difficult  \n• Main risk stems from incomplete data, not from negative findings  \n\nConclusion:  \nCurrently **low-risk**, but with **high uncertainty** due to lack of verifiable background details.\n\n------------------------------------------------  \nSECTION 8 — Errors & Warnings  \n------------------------------------------------  \nAI_Tool returned a valid response and no technical errors occurred.  \nNo warnings to report.  \n\n------------------------------------------------  \nSECTION 9 — Suggestions (Generated via AI_Tool Requirement)  \n------------------------------------------------  \n\nBased on the absence of detailed background information, it is recommended to perform extended investigation on:\n\n• **Companies**:  \n– Any entities associated with INN 525602539701 (even historically)  \n– Companies registered in Nizhny Novgorod region (typical INN prefix 5256) that may have indirect links\n\n• **Persons**:  \n– Individuals sharing the same surname and region in Russian corporate registries  \n– Possible relatives appearing in the same registry clusters  \n– Beneficial owners or founders appearing on ogrn.site in proximity to the profile  \n\nThese further checks may reveal indirect associations or hidden corporate links.",

We encourage\nothers to verify and cross-reference our work.\nDisclaimer\nIntroduction\nThis report investigates how the Ukrainian company Cryoin Engineering and its\nRussian partner, Business Management, have evaded sanctions to continue their\ntrade in rare gases. In 2022, both companies and their owners were prosecuted\nin Ukraine, revealing a network of Cypriot and Turkish entities used to bypass\ntrade restrictions. Despite these legal actions, the companies have relocated\ntheir operations to Romania, resuming inert gas production.\nThe report begins by detailing the importance of rare gases and the roles Ukraine\nand Russia historically played in the global market. It then covers the sanctioned\ntrade practices under investigation and concludes with an analysis of a newer,\npreviously unexamined scheme.\nHow the war disrupted the rare gases market\nRare gases, or noble gases, include helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and\nradon. These inert gases are chemically stable and resistant to reactions, making\nthem ideal for preserving goods and manufacturing sensitive materials like\nsemiconductors and lasers. Neon, krypton, and xenon are especially crucial in\nglobal trade and the primary focus of this investigation. Neon is vital for\nsemiconductors and microchips, which have applications in various sectors,\nincluding the military. Krypton and xenon also play significant roles in aerospace\nindustries.\nBefore the full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia were major players in the rare\ngases market. Ukraine produced a substantial portion of the world’s neon and\nkrypton, while Russia was a significant producer as well. The two countries’\ninterdependent supply chain was rooted in Soviet-era practices, relying on\nlarge-scale cryogenic separation and fractional distillation processes to extract\ngases from air. Russian steel manufacturers provided raw gases, which were\nthen refined in Ukraine.\nUkraine’s historical industrial base, particularly older steel mills, supported the\nproduction of noble gases. This infrastructure, a legacy of Soviet manufacturing,\nwas initially geared toward military applications, including the development of\nhigh-powered lasers and missiles. Ukrainian companies such as Cryoin\nEngineering and Ingas were vital not only to Russian industries but also to\ninternational markets.\nUkraine accounted for around 70% of global neon production and approximately\n40% of krypton. It also produced 90% of the semiconductor-grade neon used in\nU.S. industries, crucial for chip manufacturing and laser technologies. Major\ncompanies such as Cryoin Engineering and Ingas produced thousands of cubic\nmeters of these gases monthly. In contrast, while Russia had its own production\ncapabilities, its output was not as heavily emphasized in the global market as\nUkraine’s.\nThe war has severely disrupted this supply chain. Neon, a byproduct of heavy\nsteel production in the Donbas region, has become a critical concern.The\nongoing conflict has transformed this area into a war zone, marked by continuous\nshelling and Russian occupation.\nIn the wake of the conflict, trade bans were implemented. Taiwanese companies\nhalted neon exports to Russia and Belarus, while Russia restricted neon exports\nto “unfriendly” countries. This sparked initial panic in the neon market, given its\nvital role in microchip production. Although prices have since stabilized, Chinese\nand Korean companies have gained a larger share of the market. Xenon and\nkrypton have also attracted greater attention, particularly xenon, which is crucial\nfor spacecraft fuel—an area of significant interest for Russia.\nMilitary use of rare gases in Russia\nRare gases play a strategic role in military applications. Neon powers\nhigh-intensity lasers used in targeting systems and range finders, while its\nhigh-voltage indicators assist in monitoring military equipment. Krypton is used in\nspecialized vehicle and aircraft lighting to aid visibility during operations and is\nemployed in precision targeting systems. Krypton isotopes are also used to\ndetect clandestine nuclear activities, providing critical intelligence.\nXenon is essential for ion thrusters in spacecraft, making it crucial for military\nsatellites and UAVs. Its properties are also ideal for searchlights and other\nillumination systems used in military operations. Both xenon and krypton are\nintegral to laser technologies, enabling various military functions and contributing\nto the production of small satellites with potential military applications.\nThe war has highlighted the strategic importance of noble gases in modern\nwarfare, as countries secure supply chains against disruptions. Russia’s\ndependence on rare gases continues to evolve in response to interruptions in\nsupplies from Ukraine. The current demand for neon, krypton, and xenon reflects\nboth military and industrial needs, set against the backdrop of increasing\ninternational sanctions and shifting global supply pressures.\nTo mitigate shortages and safeguard national security, Russia has pivoted toward\ngreater self-sufficiency in rare gases. As global demand increases, Russia’s\nposition as a supplier may evolve, especially as it strengthens relationships with\nnon-Western countries while navigating complex geopolitical challenges.\nHowever, obtaining reliable procurement data has become more difficult due to\nRussian government restrictions on public access to information regarding critical\ngoods, including xenon and krypton.\nCase study: Cryoin Engineering\nProsecution history\nAccording to the official prosecution that formally started on 16 September 2022\n(court document), Cryoin Engineering had been evading sanctions imposed\nsince the beginning of war. In 2022, Cryoin Engineering imported rare gases to\ntheir long-standing partner in Russia, Business Management LLC, for the sum\nof approximately 1 million US dollars (court document). As noted by the\nprosecution, Business Management supplied rare gases to the manufacturers\nthat belong to the Russian military sector\n1\n.\n● There were not only business connections between Cryoin Engineering\nand Business Management. One of the owners of the former is Larisa\nBondarenko2\n, and the owner of the latter is Vitaly Bondarenko, who is\nher father. Originally from Odesa, he, just as his daughter, holds a Russian\npassport and has been working as the head of the cryogenic engineering\nfaculty of the Bauman Moscow State Technical University. He has been a\nwell-known figure both in Moscow, which we elaborate on in Section 3, and\n2 According to the registry data and court documents, Larisa Bondarenko was an ultimate beneficiary of Cryoin\nEngineering from 23 June 2016 to 06 June 2022.\n1 According to the information available, it happened before the war; however, the official data may not be very\naccurate, and in April 2024, the Russian government forbade disclosure of procurement information on strategic\nresources, including rare gases.\nOdesa, and he is an influential academic in his field. As Section 2 will\nshow, all key companies in the sanctions evasion scheme are connected\nto Vitaly Bondarenko, albeit in different manners.\nTo evade sanctions, Cryoin Engineering used a Turkish company, HE 24 ME\nGAZ (Turkey). As the official prosecution states, on 30 March 2022, the\nparticipants of the above-mentioned criminal scheme (Cryoin Engineering,\nBusiness Management) established the company as an intermediary, which\nhelped evade sanctions (court document; trading data).\nAnother actor in the scheme is SG Special Gas Trading (Cyprus), an offshore\ncompany which is also an ultimate beneficiary of Cryoin Engineering. They\nparticipated in shipments and handled financial transactions. Below you can find\nan illustration of this sanctions evasion scheme.\nLooking for workarounds\nWhile the prosecution has been underway since at least September 2022 and\nthe property arrest was issued in February 2023, Cryoin Engineering continued\nto trade with the Netherlands, USA, Germany, Poland, and other countries in\n2022 and 2023. The latest record of Cryoin Engineering trading is from 15\nSeptember 2023. (See trading data). The latest record of HE24 ME GAZ trading\nis from 27 December 2023.\nHowever, they also began to explore new routes and establish new companies.\nOn 30 June 2023, the Cryoin Europe company was founded in Romania. It has\nbeen trading with two companies: a newly-formed Rem-Profi-Komplekt from\nOdesa (see trading data) and another Romanian company, Criomec, which was\nfounded 1994.\nOn a diagram below, new companies introduced in this part, which were not\nmentioned in the official investigation, are colored in green.\nThe owner of Cryoin Europe is Cryoin Holding, a Cypriot company that has the\nsame director as SG Special Gases. Her name is Elena Denisenko (also spelled\nNtenisenko). According to the official documents (view source, p. 64), the\nultimate owner of Cryoin Europe is Larisa Bondarenko (Cryoin Engineering).\nRemarkably, Rem-Profi-Komplekt and Cryoin Europe were incorporated just as\nthe court decisions against Cryoin Engineering and SG Special Gases Trading\nwere rendered. Moreover, the court document from 11 April 2023 reveals that\nCryoin Engineering intended to relocate the equipment despite the confiscation\norder issued by authorities. If we examine the trading data between\nRem-Profi-Komplekt and Cryoin Europe, their trade actually started with\nequipment needed for rare gas production.\nAbove, you can find a fragment of the timeline that shows legal measures against\nCryoin Engineering and the incorporation of several companies in Ukraine and\nRomania.\nAccording to the trading data3\n, the only other trading partner of\nRem-Profi-Komplekt was Baytree Trading (Romanian company). This\ncompany was founded in November 2023 and also trades with Cryoin\nEngineering. It is owned by a Ukrainian national Petro Dalakov, who is a former\nstudent of Vitaly Bondarenko and a former employee of Iceblik (predecessor of\nCryoin Engineering4\n).\nAccording to Ukrainian court documents, Rem-Profi-Komplekt appealed to the\ncommercial court of the Odesa region with a claim against the Bulgarian\ncompany Baytree Trading LLC for the recovery of 509476.89 USD. Last\n4 Although the information is unconfirmed, our source in Ukraine stated that Iceblik (Odesa) was a joint\nventure by Vitaly Bondarenko and influential Russian businessmen close to the Kremlin. After a financial\ndisagreement, Bondarenko opted out and formed a new company, Cryoin Engineering, where he had\nmore control.\n3 It is notable how this data is presented on ImportGenius: BAYTREE TRADING LLC STR CALEA\nPRUTULUI NR 12800219 GALATI ROMANIA. We were not able to find a company with this name under\nthe given address. However, there is a Bulgarian company named Baytree Trading (more on it in the main\ntext), and the address coincides with the residence of the previously mentioned Criomec. The latter is a\nRomanian company that trades with Cryoin Europe and works on construction of its production site.\ndeliveries of inert gases dated 5 December 2023, 26 December 2023, and 30\nDecember 2023. Baytree Trading LLC reported the impossibility of making\npayments under the above-mentioned contract due to an unsatisfactory financial\nsituation. It also shows the connection between Ukrainian “new company”\nRem-Profi-Komplekt and old players, and it proves that Rem-Profi-Komplekt sells\ninert gases abroad.\nAnother Ukrainian company that has been trading with HE24 GAZ since July\n2023, is UU Invest (see this link). After 7 December 2022, it replaced Cryoin\nEngineering as a Ukrainian partner of HE24 GAZ who, in turn, traded with Russia\nuntil the very end of 2023.\nAccording to the Ukrainian court database, UU Invest was involved in cases\nconcerning the supply of substandard medical oxygen to hospitals during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. They were also indirectly involved in cases of “financing\nterrorism”.\nThe last actor we were able to identify in this sanctions evasion scheme is a\nJapanese company Iskra Industry Co. Ltd. It has traded with both Cryoin\nEngineering and Business Management since before the war began. Although\nIskra Industry Co. is a Japanese company established in 1960, it has been\nclosely linked to Russia for a long time; the company was founded with the goal\nof trading with the Soviet Union. Even today, Russia remains its main trading\npartner.\nRussian connections of Vitaly Bondarenko\nAs head of the cryogenic department of the Bauman Moscow State Technical\nUniversity, Vitaly Bondarenko has numerous connections with the Russian\nestablishment. His faculty took part in various large-scale governmental projects.\nIn July 2022, a facility for the production of pure neon was launched on behalf of\nthe Russian government on property of the Bauman Moscow State Technical\nUniversity. This was personally reported to Putin by Denis Manturov, Minister of\nIndustry and Trade, who was present at the opening.\nA more detailed scheme showing links found in the investigation:\nHowever, there is another set of Russian companies that are connected to\nBondarenko via the Turkish company HE24 ME GAZ, which, according to the\nUkrainian prosecution (see Section 1), was created with participation of Cryoin\nEngineering and Business Management to evade sanctions.\nRemarkably, it is very likely that HE24 ME GAZ is also connected with the\nRussian oligarchs. The registering person5 for the company’s website is\nAlexander Bazvanov. He is also a director of Tekhmed (LLC TechMed) and\none of the shareholders in DBB (more on this company below). HE24 ME GAZ\nwas a top buyer from Tekhmed in 2023 and 2022.\nTekhmed is under sanctions by Poland. The rationale for sanctioning was that the\ncompany “[..] has long-standing trade relations with Russian energy companies\nand Russian military departments6\n. One of TechMed’s key clients is the\nstate-owned Rosenergoatom – the operator of nuclear power plants in the\nRussian Federation, which is part of the state corporation Rosatom. The majority\nshareholder of TechMed – Andrey Dubovskov – until 2021 was among the\n6 You can see the list of Tekhmed’s trading buyers here: https://www.rusprofile.ru/id/6168752.\n5 Bazvanov has several other websites registered to him: raregaz.com and inertgaz.com. Both are\nregistered in Turkey and have an almost identical design. The role and activities of these companies are\nyet to be established.\ngroup of top managers associated with the Russian oligarch Vladimir\nYevtushenkov. TechMed is listed as a cooperating entity with the Ministry of\nDefense of the Russian Federation, to which it supplies specialized gases”\n(emphasis mine).\nTekhmed is not the only company associated with Andrey Dubovskov that has\nbeen trading with HE24 ME GAZ. Tekhnologiya, which is part of Dubovskov’s\nDBB LTD, traded with the Turkish company and had a contract with the Russian\nministry of defense in 2023.\nTo illustrate the extent of Bondarenko’s connections in Russia, one of Business\nManagement trading partners is Ksenon (Moscow). Its owner, Sergey Goroshkov,\nshares the surname and a residential address with Sofia Goroshkova, who is a\ndirector of Business Management.\nRare gas production in the so-called DNR\nTechnicheskiye materialy was registered in July 2022 in Mariupol on the\npremises of Ingas, which is another rare gas manufacturer who fled the\noccupation and moved their production to Odesa. Technisheskiye materialy has\ntwo owners: Stanislav Komarovsky, originally from Mariupol and with 30 years\nof experience at Azovstal, and Alash Dadashov, a Chechenian who formerly\nserved as director of the Akhmat club in Moscow, directly associated with\nRamzan Kadyrov.\nIn January 2024, the company's website published information regarding the\nresumption of production, along with a job posting. In the video posted by the\nDNR government in December 2023, Stanislav Komarovsky stated that they sent\ntheir production to the Bauman Moscow State Technical University for research\npurposes7\n. Since Vitaly Bondarenko’s faculty specializes in rare gases, it is highly\nprobable that they were a recipient of the production of Tekhnicheskiye materialy.\nDiagram of the investigation showing the probable connection chain:\nIn July 2024, the Ukrainian ASSET RECOVERY AND MANAGEMENT AGENCY\nannounced a competition for a manager position for the assets and corporate\nrights of Cryoin Engineering, as well as the seized property of its actual owners.\nWe are still awaiting the final decision.\nConclusion\nFrom our findings, it seems highly plausible that this sanctions evasion scheme\nand the actors involved in it were recently active in the regions and businesses\nmentioned in our report. We are also confident of the likelihood of their\nconnections to the Russian government. Therefore, we assert that it is crucial to\ninvestigate this scheme further. Specifically, it is imperative to investigate any and\nall EU-based entities and their connections to this scheme and/or its actors.We\nencourage both official accountability groups and civil society to use the\n7 According to the company’s website, another buyer of Tekhnicheskiye materialy is Roscosmos\n(Russian aerospace agency). Roscosmos particularly needs xenon and krypton, which are used as fuel\nfor rockets. In December 2022, a shortage of xenon was reported, which was a problem for the realization\nof the Sfera state project. Sfera launches small satellites, which can be used for military purposes, among\nother things (More on military space programs 1, more on military space programs 2). Just as neon,\nkrypton and xenon are areas of specialization and interest of Bondarenko’s faculty at Bauman Moscow\nState Technical University, which also participates in the Sfera project. In March 2023, it was reported that\nRussia’s first krypton-powered satellite was launched.\ninformation uncovered by OSINT FOR UKRAINE to look deeper into this\nscheme.\nRare gases are a key resource for a global semiconductor production leading\ninnovation in various spheres, including military technology. Russia’s control over\nthe captured areas with natural resources combined with the possibility to utilize\nits existing production chains enables it to support its war machine, leading to\nserious implications for global safety. Therefore, it is crucial that this sanctions\nevasion scheme is brought to the attention of accountability bodies and\ninvestigated further.\nFor more details, users with a registered account in Aleph can view a full timeline\nin the OFU project through this link.",

In 2022, both companies and their owners were prosecuted\nin Ukraine, revealing a network of Cypriot and Turkish entities used to bypass\ntrade restrictions. Despite these legal actions, the companies have relocated\ntheir operations to Romania, resuming inert gas production.\nThe report begins by detailing the importance of rare gases and the roles Ukraine\nand Russia historically played in the global market. It then covers the sanctioned\ntrade practices under investigation and concludes with an analysis of a newer,\npreviously unexamined scheme.\nHow the war disrupted the rare gases market\nRare gases, or noble gases, include helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and\nradon. These inert gases are chemically stable and resistant to reactions, making\nthem ideal for preserving goods and manufacturing sensitive materials like\nsemiconductors and lasers. Neon, krypton, and xenon are especially crucial in\nglobal trade and the primary focus of this investigation. Neon is vital for\nsemiconductors and microchips, which have applications in various sectors,\nincluding the military. Krypton and xenon also play significant roles in aerospace\nindustries.\nBefore the full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia were major players in the rare\ngases market. Ukraine produced a substantial portion of the world’s neon and\nkrypton, while Russia was a significant producer as well. The two countries’\ninterdependent supply chain was rooted in Soviet-era practices, relying on\nlarge-scale cryogenic separation and fractional distillation processes to extract\ngases from air. Russian steel manufacturers provided raw gases, which were\nthen refined in Ukraine.\nUkraine’s historical industrial base, particularly older steel mills, supported the\nproduction of noble gases. This infrastructure, a legacy of Soviet manufacturing,\nwas initially geared toward military applications, including the development of\nhigh-powered lasers and missiles. Ukrainian companies such as Cryoin\nEngineering and Ingas were vital not only to Russian industries but also to\ninternational markets.\nUkraine accounted for around 70% of global neon production and approximately\n40% of krypton. It also produced 90% of the semiconductor-grade neon used in\nU.S. industries, crucial for chip manufacturing and laser technologies. Major\ncompanies such as Cryoin Engineering and Ingas produced thousands of cubic\nmeters of these gases monthly. In contrast, while Russia had its own production\ncapabilities, its output was not as heavily emphasized in the global market as\nUkraine’s.\nThe war has severely disrupted this supply chain. Neon, a byproduct of heavy\nsteel production in the Donbas region, has become a critical concern.The\nongoing conflict has transformed this area into a war zone, marked by continuous\nshelling and Russian occupation.\nIn the wake of the conflict, trade bans were implemented. Taiwanese companies\nhalted neon exports to Russia and Belarus, while Russia restricted neon exports\nto “unfriendly” countries. This sparked initial panic in the neon market, given its\nvital role in microchip production. Although prices have since stabilized, Chinese\nand Korean companies have gained a larger share of the market. Xenon and\nkrypton have also attracted greater attention, particularly xenon, which is crucial\nfor spacecraft fuel—an area of significant interest for Russia.\nMilitary use of rare gases in Russia\nRare gases play a strategic role in military applications. Neon powers\nhigh-intensity lasers used in targeting systems and range finders, while its\nhigh-voltage indicators assist in monitoring military equipment. Krypton is used in\nspecialized vehicle and aircraft lighting to aid visibility during operations and is\nemployed in precision targeting systems. Krypton isotopes are also used to\ndetect clandestine nuclear activities, providing critical intelligence.\nXenon is essential for ion thrusters in spacecraft, making it crucial for military\nsatellites and UAVs. Its properties are also ideal for searchlights and other\nillumination systems used in military operations. Both xenon and krypton are\nintegral to laser technologies, enabling various military functions and contributing\nto the production of small satellites with potential military applications.\nThe war has highlighted the strategic importance of noble gases in modern\nwarfare, as countries secure supply chains against disruptions. Russia’s\ndependence on rare gases continues to evolve in response to interruptions in\nsupplies from Ukraine. The current demand for neon, krypton, and xenon reflects\nboth military and industrial needs, set against the backdrop of increasing\ninternational sanctions and shifting global supply pressures.\nTo mitigate shortages and safeguard national security, Russia has pivoted toward\ngreater self-sufficiency in rare gases. As global demand increases, Russia’s\nposition as a supplier may evolve, especially as it strengthens relationships with\nnon-Western countries while navigating complex geopolitical challenges.\nHowever, obtaining reliable procurement data has become more difficult due to\nRussian government restrictions on public access to information regarding critical\ngoods, including xenon and krypton.\nCase study: Cryoin Engineering\nProsecution history\nAccording to the official prosecution that formally started on 16 September 2022\n(court document), Cryoin Engineering had been evading sanctions imposed\nsince the beginning of war. In 2022, Cryoin Engineering imported rare gases to\ntheir long-standing partner in Russia, Business Management LLC, for the sum\nof approximately 1 million US dollars (court document). As noted by the\nprosecution, Business Management supplied rare gases to the manufacturers\nthat belong to the Russian military sector\n1\n.\n● There were not only business connections between Cryoin Engineering\nand Business Management. One of the owners of the former is Larisa\nBondarenko2\n, and the owner of the latter is Vitaly Bondarenko, who is\nher father. Originally from Odesa, he, just as his daughter, holds a Russian\npassport and has been working as the head of the cryogenic engineering\nfaculty of the Bauman Moscow State Technical University. He has been a\nwell-known figure both in Moscow, which we elaborate on in Section 3, and\n2 According to the registry data and court documents, Larisa Bondarenko was an ultimate beneficiary of Cryoin\nEngineering from 23 June 2016 to 06 June 2022.\n1 According to the information available, it happened before the war; however, the official data may not be very\naccurate, and in April 2024, the Russian government forbade disclosure of procurement information on strategic\nresources, including rare gases.\nOdesa, and he is an influential academic in his field. As Section 2 will\nshow, all key companies in the sanctions evasion scheme are connected\nto Vitaly Bondarenko, albeit in different manners.\nTo evade sanctions, Cryoin Engineering used a Turkish company, HE 24 ME\nGAZ (Turkey). As the official prosecution states, on 30 March 2022, the\nparticipants of the above-mentioned criminal scheme (Cryoin Engineering,\nBusiness Management) established the company as an intermediary, which\nhelped evade sanctions (court document; trading data).\nAnother actor in the scheme is SG Special Gas Trading (Cyprus), an offshore\ncompany which is also an ultimate beneficiary of Cryoin Engineering. They\nparticipated in shipments and handled financial transactions. Below you can find\nan illustration of this sanctions evasion scheme.\nLooking for workarounds\nWhile the prosecution has been underway since at least September 2022 and\nthe property arrest was issued in February 2023, Cryoin Engineering continued\nto trade with the Netherlands, USA, Germany, Poland, and other countries in\n2022 and 2023. The latest record of Cryoin Engineering trading is from 15\nSeptember 2023. (See trading data). The latest record of HE24 ME GAZ trading\nis from 27 December 2023.\nHowever, they also began to explore new routes and establish new companies.\nOn 30 June 2023, the Cryoin Europe company was founded in Romania. It has\nbeen trading with two companies: a newly-formed Rem-Profi-Komplekt from\nOdesa (see trading data) and another Romanian company, Criomec, which was\nfounded 1994.\nOn a diagram below, new companies introduced in this part, which were not\nmentioned in the official investigation, are colored in green.\nThe owner of Cryoin Europe is Cryoin Holding, a Cypriot company that has the\nsame director as SG Special Gases. Her name is Elena Denisenko (also spelled\nNtenisenko). According to the official documents (view source, p. 64), the\nultimate owner of Cryoin Europe is Larisa Bondarenko (Cryoin Engineering).\nRemarkably, Rem-Profi-Komplekt and Cryoin Europe were incorporated just as\nthe court decisions against Cryoin Engineering and SG Special Gases Trading\nwere rendered. Moreover, the court document from 11 April 2023 reveals that\nCryoin Engineering intended to relocate the equipment despite the confiscation\norder issued by authorities. If we examine the trading data between\nRem-Profi-Komplekt and Cryoin Europe, their trade actually started with\nequipment needed for rare gas production.\nAbove, you can find a fragment of the timeline that shows legal measures against\nCryoin Engineering and the incorporation of several companies in Ukraine and\nRomania.\nAccording to the trading data3\n, the only other trading partner of\nRem-Profi-Komplekt was Baytree Trading (Romanian company). This\ncompany was founded in November 2023 and also trades with Cryoin\nEngineering. It is owned by a Ukrainian national Petro Dalakov, who is a former\nstudent of Vitaly Bondarenko and a former employee of Iceblik (predecessor of\nCryoin Engineering4\n).\nAccording to Ukrainian court documents, Rem-Profi-Komplekt appealed to the\ncommercial court of the Odesa region with a claim against the Bulgarian\ncompany Baytree Trading LLC for the recovery of 509476.89 USD. Last\n4 Although the information is unconfirmed, our source in Ukraine stated that Iceblik (Odesa) was a joint\nventure by Vitaly Bondarenko and influential Russian businessmen close to the Kremlin. After a financial\ndisagreement, Bondarenko opted out and formed a new company, Cryoin Engineering, where he had\nmore control.\n3 It is notable how this data is presented on ImportGenius: BAYTREE TRADING LLC STR CALEA\nPRUTULUI NR 12800219 GALATI ROMANIA. We were not able to find a company with this name under\nthe given address. However, there is a Bulgarian company named Baytree Trading (more on it in the main\ntext), and the address coincides with the residence of the previously mentioned Criomec. The latter is a\nRomanian company that trades with Cryoin Europe and works on construction of its production site.\ndeliveries of inert gases dated 5 December 2023, 26 December 2023, and 30\nDecember 2023. Baytree Trading LLC reported the impossibility of making\npayments under the above-mentioned contract due to an unsatisfactory financial\nsituation. It also shows the connection between Ukrainian “new company”\nRem-Profi-Komplekt and old players, and it proves that Rem-Profi-Komplekt sells\ninert gases abroad.\nAnother Ukrainian company that has been trading with HE24 GAZ since July\n2023, is UU Invest (see this link). After 7 December 2022, it replaced Cryoin\nEngineering as a Ukrainian partner of HE24 GAZ who, in turn, traded with Russia\nuntil the very end of 2023.\nAccording to the Ukrainian court database, UU Invest was involved in cases\nconcerning the supply of substandard medical oxygen to hospitals during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. They were also indirectly involved in cases of “financing\nterrorism”.\nThe last actor we were able to identify in this sanctions evasion scheme is a\nJapanese company Iskra Industry Co. Ltd. It has traded with both Cryoin\nEngineering and Business Management since before the war began. Although\nIskra Industry Co. is a Japanese company established in 1960, it has been\nclosely linked to Russia for a long time; the company was founded with the goal\nof trading with the Soviet Union. Even today, Russia remains its main trading\npartner.\nRussian connections of Vitaly Bondarenko\nAs head of the cryogenic department of the Bauman Moscow State Technical\nUniversity, Vitaly Bondarenko has numerous connections with the Russian\nestablishment. His faculty took part in various large-scale governmental projects.\nIn July 2022, a facility for the production of pure neon was launched on behalf of\nthe Russian government on property of the Bauman Moscow State Technical\nUniversity. This was personally reported to Putin by Denis Manturov, Minister of\nIndustry and Trade, who was present at the opening.\nA more detailed scheme showing links found in the investigation:\nHowever, there is another set of Russian companies that are connected to\nBondarenko via the Turkish company HE24 ME GAZ, which, according to the\nUkrainian prosecution (see Section 1), was created with participation of Cryoin\nEngineering and Business Management to evade sanctions.\nRemarkably, it is very likely that HE24 ME GAZ is also connected with the\nRussian oligarchs.

Originally from Odesa, he, just as his daughter, holds a Russian\npassport and has been working as the head of the cryogenic engineering\nfaculty of the Bauman Moscow State Technical University. He has been a\nwell-known figure both in Moscow, which we elaborate on in Section 3, and\n2 According to the registry data and court documents, Larisa Bondarenko was an ultimate beneficiary of Cryoin\nEngineering from 23 June 2016 to 06 June 2022.\n1 According to the information available, it happened before the war; however, the official data may not be very\naccurate, and in April 2024, the Russian government forbade disclosure of procurement information on strategic\nresources, including rare gases.\nOdesa, and he is an influential academic in his field. As Section 2 will\nshow, all key companies in the sanctions evasion scheme are connected\nto Vitaly Bondarenko, albeit in different manners.\nTo evade sanctions, Cryoin Engineering used a Turkish company, HE 24 ME\nGAZ (Turkey). As the official prosecution states, on 30 March 2022, the\nparticipants of the above-mentioned criminal scheme (Cryoin Engineering,\nBusiness Management) established the company as an intermediary, which\nhelped evade sanctions (court document; trading data).\nAnother actor in the scheme is SG Special Gas Trading (Cyprus), an offshore\ncompany which is also an ultimate beneficiary of Cryoin Engineering. They\nparticipated in shipments and handled financial transactions. Below you can find\nan illustration of this sanctions evasion scheme.\nLooking for workarounds\nWhile the prosecution has been underway since at least September 2022 and\nthe property arrest was issued in February 2023, Cryoin Engineering continued\nto trade with the Netherlands, USA, Germany, Poland, and other countries in\n2022 and 2023. The latest record of Cryoin Engineering trading is from 15\nSeptember 2023. (See trading data). The latest record of HE24 ME GAZ trading\nis from 27 December 2023.\nHowever, they also began to explore new routes and establish new companies.\nOn 30 June 2023, the Cryoin Europe company was founded in Romania. It has\nbeen trading with two companies: a newly-formed Rem-Profi-Komplekt from\nOdesa (see trading data) and another Romanian company, Criomec, which was\nfounded 1994.\nOn a diagram below, new companies introduced in this part, which were not\nmentioned in the official investigation, are colored in green.\nThe owner of Cryoin Europe is Cryoin Holding, a Cypriot company that has the\nsame director as SG Special Gases. Her name is Elena Denisenko (also spelled\nNtenisenko). According to the official documents (view source, p. 64), the\nultimate owner of Cryoin Europe is Larisa Bondarenko (Cryoin Engineering).\nRemarkably, Rem-Profi-Komplekt and Cryoin Europe were incorporated just as\nthe court decisions against Cryoin Engineering and SG Special Gases Trading\nwere rendered. Moreover, the court document from 11 April 2023 reveals that\nCryoin Engineering intended to relocate the equipment despite the confiscation\norder issued by authorities. If we examine the trading data between\nRem-Profi-Komplekt and Cryoin Europe, their trade actually started with\nequipment needed for rare gas production.\nAbove, you can find a fragment of the timeline that shows legal measures against\nCryoin Engineering and the incorporation of several companies in Ukraine and\nRomania.\nAccording to the trading data3\n, the only other trading partner of\nRem-Profi-Komplekt was Baytree Trading (Romanian company). This\ncompany was founded in November 2023 and also trades with Cryoin\nEngineering. It is owned by a Ukrainian national Petro Dalakov, who is a former\nstudent of Vitaly Bondarenko and a former employee of Iceblik (predecessor of\nCryoin Engineering4\n).\nAccording to Ukrainian court documents, Rem-Profi-Komplekt appealed to the\ncommercial court of the Odesa region with a claim against the Bulgarian\ncompany Baytree Trading LLC for the recovery of 509476.89 USD. Last\n4 Although the information is unconfirmed, our source in Ukraine stated that Iceblik (Odesa) was a joint\nventure by Vitaly Bondarenko and influential Russian businessmen close to the Kremlin. After a financial\ndisagreement, Bondarenko opted out and formed a new company, Cryoin Engineering, where he had\nmore control.\n3 It is notable how this data is presented on ImportGenius: BAYTREE TRADING LLC STR CALEA\nPRUTULUI NR 12800219 GALATI ROMANIA. We were not able to find a company with this name under\nthe given address. However, there is a Bulgarian company named Baytree Trading (more on it in the main\ntext), and the address coincides with the residence of the previously mentioned Criomec. The latter is a\nRomanian company that trades with Cryoin Europe and works on construction of its production site.\ndeliveries of inert gases dated 5 December 2023, 26 December 2023, and 30\nDecember 2023. Baytree Trading LLC reported the impossibility of making\npayments under the above-mentioned contract due to an unsatisfactory financial\nsituation. It also shows the connection between Ukrainian “new company”\nRem-Profi-Komplekt and old players, and it proves that Rem-Profi-Komplekt sells\ninert gases abroad.\nAnother Ukrainian company that has been trading with HE24 GAZ since July\n2023, is UU Invest (see this link). After 7 December 2022, it replaced Cryoin\nEngineering as a Ukrainian partner of HE24 GAZ who, in turn, traded with Russia\nuntil the very end of 2023.\nAccording to the Ukrainian court database, UU Invest was involved in cases\nconcerning the supply of substandard medical oxygen to hospitals during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. They were also indirectly involved in cases of “financing\nterrorism”.\nThe last actor we were able to identify in this sanctions evasion scheme is a\nJapanese company Iskra Industry Co. Ltd. It has traded with both Cryoin\nEngineering and Business Management since before the war began. Although\nIskra Industry Co. is a Japanese company established in 1960, it has been\nclosely linked to Russia for a long time; the company was founded with the goal\nof trading with the Soviet Union. Even today, Russia remains its main trading\npartner.\nRussian connections of Vitaly Bondarenko\nAs head of the cryogenic department of the Bauman Moscow State Technical\nUniversity, Vitaly Bondarenko has numerous connections with the Russian\nestablishment. His faculty took part in various large-scale governmental projects.\nIn July 2022, a facility for the production of pure neon was launched on behalf of\nthe Russian government on property of the Bauman Moscow State Technical\nUniversity. This was personally reported to Putin by Denis Manturov, Minister of\nIndustry and Trade, who was present at the opening.\nA more detailed scheme showing links found in the investigation:\nHowever, there is another set of Russian companies that are connected to\nBondarenko via the Turkish company HE24 ME GAZ, which, according to the\nUkrainian prosecution (see Section 1), was created with participation of Cryoin\nEngineering and Business Management to evade sanctions.\nRemarkably, it is very likely that HE24 ME GAZ is also connected with the\nRussian oligarchs. The registering person5 for the company’s website is\nAlexander Bazvanov. He is also a director of Tekhmed (LLC TechMed) and\none of the shareholders in DBB (more on this company below). HE24 ME GAZ\nwas a top buyer from Tekhmed in 2023 and 2022.\nTekhmed is under sanctions by Poland.

We encourage\nothers to verify and cross-reference our work.\nDisclaimer\nIntroduction\nThis report investigates how the Ukrainian company Cryoin Engineering and its\nRussian partner, Business Management, have evaded sanctions to continue their\ntrade in rare gases. In 2022, both companies and their owners were prosecuted\nin Ukraine, revealing a network of Cypriot and Turkish entities used to bypass\ntrade restrictions. Despite these legal actions, the companies have relocated\ntheir operations to Romania, resuming inert gas production.\nThe report begins by detailing the importance of rare gases and the roles Ukraine\nand Russia historically played in the global market. It then covers the sanctioned\ntrade practices under investigation and concludes with an analysis of a newer,\npreviously unexamined scheme.\nHow the war disrupted the rare gases market\nRare gases, or noble gases, include helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and\nradon. These inert gases are chemically stable and resistant to reactions, making\nthem ideal for preserving goods and manufacturing sensitive materials like\nsemiconductors and lasers. Neon, krypton, and xenon are especially crucial in\nglobal trade and the primary focus of this investigation. Neon is vital for\nsemiconductors and microchips, which have applications in various sectors,\nincluding the military. Krypton and xenon also play significant roles in aerospace\nindustries.\nBefore the full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia were major players in the rare\ngases market. Ukraine produced a substantial portion of the world’s neon and\nkrypton, while Russia was a significant producer as well. The two countries’\ninterdependent supply chain was rooted in Soviet-era practices, relying on\nlarge-scale cryogenic separation and fractional distillation processes to extract\ngases from air. Russian steel manufacturers provided raw gases, which were\nthen refined in Ukraine.\nUkraine’s historical industrial base, particularly older steel mills, supported the\nproduction of noble gases. This infrastructure, a legacy of Soviet manufacturing,\nwas initially geared toward military applications, including the development of\nhigh-powered lasers and missiles. Ukrainian companies such as Cryoin\nEngineering and Ingas were vital not only to Russian industries but also to\ninternational markets.\nUkraine accounted for around 70% of global neon production and approximately\n40% of krypton. It also produced 90% of the semiconductor-grade neon used in\nU.S. industries, crucial for chip manufacturing and laser technologies. Major\ncompanies such as Cryoin Engineering and Ingas produced thousands of cubic\nmeters of these gases monthly. In contrast, while Russia had its own production\ncapabilities, its output was not as heavily emphasized in the global market as\nUkraine’s.\nThe war has severely disrupted this supply chain. Neon, a byproduct of heavy\nsteel production in the Donbas region, has become a critical concern.The\nongoing conflict has transformed this area into a war zone, marked by continuous\nshelling and Russian occupation.\nIn the wake of the conflict, trade bans were implemented. Taiwanese companies\nhalted neon exports to Russia and Belarus, while Russia restricted neon exports\nto “unfriendly” countries. This sparked initial panic in the neon market, given its\nvital role in microchip production. Although prices have since stabilized, Chinese\nand Korean companies have gained a larger share of the market. Xenon and\nkrypton have also attracted greater attention, particularly xenon, which is crucial\nfor spacecraft fuel—an area of significant interest for Russia.\nMilitary use of rare gases in Russia\nRare gases play a strategic role in military applications. Neon powers\nhigh-intensity lasers used in targeting systems and range finders, while its\nhigh-voltage indicators assist in monitoring military equipment. Krypton is used in\nspecialized vehicle and aircraft lighting to aid visibility during operations and is\nemployed in precision targeting systems. Krypton isotopes are also used to\ndetect clandestine nuclear activities, providing critical intelligence.\nXenon is essential for ion thrusters in spacecraft, making it crucial for military\nsatellites and UAVs. Its properties are also ideal for searchlights and other\nillumination systems used in military operations. Both xenon and krypton are\nintegral to laser technologies, enabling various military functions and contributing\nto the production of small satellites with potential military applications.\nThe war has highlighted the strategic importance of noble gases in modern\nwarfare, as countries secure supply chains against disruptions. Russia’s\ndependence on rare gases continues to evolve in response to interruptions in\nsupplies from Ukraine. The current demand for neon, krypton, and xenon reflects\nboth military and industrial needs, set against the backdrop of increasing\ninternational sanctions and shifting global supply pressures.\nTo mitigate shortages and safeguard national security, Russia has pivoted toward\ngreater self-sufficiency in rare gases. As global demand increases, Russia’s\nposition as a supplier may evolve, especially as it strengthens relationships with\nnon-Western countries while navigating complex geopolitical challenges.\nHowever, obtaining reliable procurement data has become more difficult due to\nRussian government restrictions on public access to information regarding critical\ngoods, including xenon and krypton.\nCase study: Cryoin Engineering\nProsecution history\nAccording to the official prosecution that formally started on 16 September 2022\n(court document), Cryoin Engineering had been evading sanctions imposed\nsince the beginning of war. In 2022, Cryoin Engineering imported rare gases to\ntheir long-standing partner in Russia, Business Management LLC, for the sum\nof approximately 1 million US dollars (court document). As noted by the\nprosecution, Business Management supplied rare gases to the manufacturers\nthat belong to the Russian military sector\n1\n.\n● There were not only business connections between Cryoin Engineering\nand Business Management.

In 2022, both companies and their owners were prosecuted\nin Ukraine, revealing a network of Cypriot and Turkish entities used to bypass\ntrade restrictions. Despite these legal actions, the companies have relocated\ntheir operations to Romania, resuming inert gas production.\nThe report begins by detailing the importance of rare gases and the roles Ukraine\nand Russia historically played in the global market. It then covers the sanctioned\ntrade practices under investigation and concludes with an analysis of a newer,\npreviously unexamined scheme.\nHow the war disrupted the rare gases market\nRare gases, or noble gases, include helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and\nradon. These inert gases are chemically stable and resistant to reactions, making\nthem ideal for preserving goods and manufacturing sensitive materials like\nsemiconductors and lasers. Neon, krypton, and xenon are especially crucial in\nglobal trade and the primary focus of this investigation. Neon is vital for\nsemiconductors and microchips, which have applications in various sectors,\nincluding the military. Krypton and xenon also play significant roles in aerospace\nindustries.\nBefore the full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia were major players in the rare\ngases market. Ukraine produced a substantial portion of the world’s neon and\nkrypton, while Russia was a significant producer as well. The two countries’\ninterdependent supply chain was rooted in Soviet-era practices, relying on\nlarge-scale cryogenic separation and fractional distillation processes to extract\ngases from air. Russian steel manufacturers provided raw gases, which were\nthen refined in Ukraine.\nUkraine’s historical industrial base, particularly older steel mills, supported the\nproduction of noble gases. This infrastructure, a legacy of Soviet manufacturing,\nwas initially geared toward military applications, including the development of\nhigh-powered lasers and missiles. Ukrainian companies such as Cryoin\nEngineering and Ingas were vital not only to Russian industries but also to\ninternational markets.\nUkraine accounted for around 70% of global neon production and approximately\n40% of krypton. It also produced 90% of the semiconductor-grade neon used in\nU.S. industries, crucial for chip manufacturing and laser technologies. Major\ncompanies such as Cryoin Engineering and Ingas produced thousands of cubic\nmeters of these gases monthly. In contrast, while Russia had its own production\ncapabilities, its output was not as heavily emphasized in the global market as\nUkraine’s.\nThe war has severely disrupted this supply chain. Neon, a byproduct of heavy\nsteel production in the Donbas region, has become a critical concern.The\nongoing conflict has transformed this area into a war zone, marked by continuous\nshelling and Russian occupation.\nIn the wake of the conflict, trade bans were implemented. Taiwanese companies\nhalted neon exports to Russia and Belarus, while Russia restricted neon exports\nto “unfriendly” countries. This sparked initial panic in the neon market, given its\nvital role in microchip production. Although prices have since stabilized, Chinese\nand Korean companies have gained a larger share of the market. Xenon and\nkrypton have also attracted greater attention, particularly xenon, which is crucial\nfor spacecraft fuel—an area of significant interest for Russia.\nMilitary use of rare gases in Russia\nRare gases play a strategic role in military applications. Neon powers\nhigh-intensity lasers used in targeting systems and range finders, while its\nhigh-voltage indicators assist in monitoring military equipment. Krypton is used in\nspecialized vehicle and aircraft lighting to aid visibility during operations and is\nemployed in precision targeting systems. Krypton isotopes are also used to\ndetect clandestine nuclear activities, providing critical intelligence.\nXenon is essential for ion thrusters in spacecraft, making it crucial for military\nsatellites and UAVs. Its properties are also ideal for searchlights and other\nillumination systems used in military operations. Both xenon and krypton are\nintegral to laser technologies, enabling various military functions and contributing\nto the production of small satellites with potential military applications.\nThe war has highlighted the strategic importance of noble gases in modern\nwarfare, as countries secure supply chains against disruptions. Russia’s\ndependence on rare gases continues to evolve in response to interruptions in\nsupplies from Ukraine. The current demand for neon, krypton, and xenon reflects\nboth military and industrial needs, set against the backdrop of increasing\ninternational sanctions and shifting global supply pressures.\nTo mitigate shortages and safeguard national security, Russia has pivoted toward\ngreater self-sufficiency in rare gases. As global demand increases, Russia’s\nposition as a supplier may evolve, especially as it strengthens relationships with\nnon-Western countries while navigating complex geopolitical challenges.\nHowever, obtaining reliable procurement data has become more difficult due to\nRussian government restrictions on public access to information regarding critical\ngoods, including xenon and krypton.\nCase study: Cryoin Engineering\nProsecution history\nAccording to the official prosecution that formally started on 16 September 2022\n(court document), Cryoin Engineering had been evading sanctions imposed\nsince the beginning of war. In 2022, Cryoin Engineering imported rare gases to\ntheir long-standing partner in Russia, Business Management LLC, for the sum\nof approximately 1 million US dollars (court document). As noted by the\nprosecution, Business Management supplied rare gases to the manufacturers\nthat belong to the Russian military sector\n1\n.\n● There were not only business connections between Cryoin Engineering\nand Business Management. One of the owners of the former is Larisa\nBondarenko2\n, and the owner of the latter is Vitaly Bondarenko, who is\nher father. Originally from Odesa, he, just as his daughter, holds a Russian\npassport and has been working as the head of the cryogenic engineering\nfaculty of the Bauman Moscow State Technical University. He has been a\nwell-known figure both in Moscow, which we elaborate on in Section 3, and\n2 According to the registry data and court documents, Larisa Bondarenko was an ultimate beneficiary of Cryoin\nEngineering from 23 June 2016 to 06 June 2022.\n1 According to the information available, it happened before the war; however, the official data may not be very\naccurate, and in April 2024, the Russian government forbade disclosure of procurement information on strategic\nresources, including rare gases.\nOdesa, and he is an influential academic in his field. As Section 2 will\nshow, all key companies in the sanctions evasion scheme are connected\nto Vitaly Bondarenko, albeit in different manners.\nTo evade sanctions, Cryoin Engineering used a Turkish company, HE 24 ME\nGAZ (Turkey). As the official prosecution states, on 30 March 2022, the\nparticipants of the above-mentioned criminal scheme (Cryoin Engineering,\nBusiness Management) established the company as an intermediary, which\nhelped evade sanctions (court document; trading data).\nAnother actor in the scheme is SG Special Gas Trading (Cyprus), an offshore\ncompany which is also an ultimate beneficiary of Cryoin Engineering. They\nparticipated in shipments and handled financial transactions. Below you can find\nan illustration of this sanctions evasion scheme.\nLooking for workarounds\nWhile the prosecution has been underway since at least September 2022 and\nthe property arrest was issued in February 2023, Cryoin Engineering continued\nto trade with the Netherlands, USA, Germany, Poland, and other countries in\n2022 and 2023. The latest record of Cryoin Engineering trading is from 15\nSeptember 2023. (See trading data). The latest record of HE24 ME GAZ trading\nis from 27 December 2023.\nHowever, they also began to explore new routes and establish new companies.\nOn 30 June 2023, the Cryoin Europe company was founded in Romania. It has\nbeen trading with two companies: a newly-formed Rem-Profi-Komplekt from\nOdesa (see trading data) and another Romanian company, Criomec, which was\nfounded 1994.\nOn a diagram below, new companies introduced in this part, which were not\nmentioned in the official investigation, are colored in green.\nThe owner of Cryoin Europe is Cryoin Holding, a Cypriot company that has the\nsame director as SG Special Gases. Her name is Elena Denisenko (also spelled\nNtenisenko). According to the official documents (view source, p. 64), the\nultimate owner of Cryoin Europe is Larisa Bondarenko (Cryoin Engineering).\nRemarkably, Rem-Profi-Komplekt and Cryoin Europe were incorporated just as\nthe court decisions against Cryoin Engineering and SG Special Gases Trading\nwere rendered. Moreover, the court document from 11 April 2023 reveals that\nCryoin Engineering intended to relocate the equipment despite the confiscation\norder issued by authorities. If we examine the trading data between\nRem-Profi-Komplekt and Cryoin Europe, their trade actually started with\nequipment needed for rare gas production.\nAbove, you can find a fragment of the timeline that shows legal measures against\nCryoin Engineering and the incorporation of several companies in Ukraine and\nRomania.\nAccording to the trading data3\n, the only other trading partner of\nRem-Profi-Komplekt was Baytree Trading (Romanian company). This\ncompany was founded in November 2023 and also trades with Cryoin\nEngineering. It is owned by a Ukrainian national Petro Dalakov, who is a former\nstudent of Vitaly Bondarenko and a former employee of Iceblik (predecessor of\nCryoin Engineering4\n).\nAccording to Ukrainian court documents, Rem-Profi-Komplekt appealed to the\ncommercial court of the Odesa region with a claim against the Bulgarian\ncompany Baytree Trading LLC for the recovery of 509476.89 USD. Last\n4 Although the information is unconfirmed, our source in Ukraine stated that Iceblik (Odesa) was a joint\nventure by Vitaly Bondarenko and influential Russian businessmen close to the Kremlin. After a financial\ndisagreement, Bondarenko opted out and formed a new company, Cryoin Engineering, where he had\nmore control.\n3 It is notable how this data is presented on ImportGenius: BAYTREE TRADING LLC STR CALEA\nPRUTULUI NR 12800219 GALATI ROMANIA. We were not able to find a company with this name under\nthe given address. However, there is a Bulgarian company named Baytree Trading (more on it in the main\ntext), and the address coincides with the residence of the previously mentioned Criomec. The latter is a\nRomanian company that trades with Cryoin Europe and works on construction of its production site.\ndeliveries of inert gases dated 5 December 2023, 26 December 2023, and 30\nDecember 2023. Baytree Trading LLC reported the impossibility of making\npayments under the above-mentioned contract due to an unsatisfactory financial\nsituation. It also shows the connection between Ukrainian “new company”\nRem-Profi-Komplekt and old players, and it proves that Rem-Profi-Komplekt sells\ninert gases abroad.\nAnother Ukrainian company that has been trading with HE24 GAZ since July\n2023, is UU Invest (see this link). After 7 December 2022, it replaced Cryoin\nEngineering as a Ukrainian partner of HE24 GAZ who, in turn, traded with Russia\nuntil the very end of 2023.\nAccording to the Ukrainian court database, UU Invest was involved in cases\nconcerning the supply of substandard medical oxygen to hospitals during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. They were also indirectly involved in cases of “financing\nterrorism”.\nThe last actor we were able to identify in this sanctions evasion scheme is a\nJapanese company Iskra Industry Co. Ltd. It has traded with both Cryoin\nEngineering and Business Management since before the war began. Although\nIskra Industry Co. is a Japanese company established in 1960, it has been\nclosely linked to Russia for a long time; the company was founded with the goal\nof trading with the Soviet Union. Even today, Russia remains its main trading\npartner.\nRussian connections of Vitaly Bondarenko\nAs head of the cryogenic department of the Bauman Moscow State Technical\nUniversity, Vitaly Bondarenko has numerous connections with the Russian\nestablishment. His faculty took part in various large-scale governmental projects.\nIn July 2022, a facility for the production of pure neon was launched on behalf of\nthe Russian government on property of the Bauman Moscow State Technical\nUniversity. This was personally reported to Putin by Denis Manturov, Minister of\nIndustry and Trade, who was present at the opening.\nA more detailed scheme showing links found in the investigation:\nHowever, there is another set of Russian companies that are connected to\nBondarenko via the Turkish company HE24 ME GAZ, which, according to the\nUkrainian prosecution (see Section 1), was created with participation of Cryoin\nEngineering and Business Management to evade sanctions.\nRemarkably, it is very likely that HE24 ME GAZ is also connected with the\nRussian oligarchs. The registering person5 for the company’s website is\nAlexander Bazvanov. He is also a director of Tekhmed (LLC TechMed) and\none of the shareholders in DBB (more on this company below). HE24 ME GAZ\nwas a top buyer from Tekhmed in 2023 and 2022.\nTekhmed is under sanctions by Poland. The rationale for sanctioning was that the\ncompany “[..] has long-standing trade relations with Russian energy companies\nand Russian military departments6\n. One of TechMed’s key clients is the\nstate-owned Rosenergoatom – the operator of nuclear power plants in the\nRussian Federation, which is part of the state corporation Rosatom. The majority\nshareholder of TechMed – Andrey Dubovskov – until 2021 was among the\n6 You can see the list of Tekhmed’s trading buyers here: https://www.rusprofile.ru/id/6168752.\n5 Bazvanov has several other websites registered to him: raregaz.com and inertgaz.com. Both are\nregistered in Turkey and have an almost identical design. The role and activities of these companies are\nyet to be established.\ngroup of top managers associated with the Russian oligarch Vladimir\nYevtushenkov. TechMed is listed as a cooperating entity with the Ministry of\nDefense of the Russian Federation, to which it supplies specialized gases”\n(emphasis mine).\nTekhmed is not the only company associated with Andrey Dubovskov that has\nbeen trading with HE24 ME GAZ. Tekhnologiya, which is part of Dubovskov’s\nDBB LTD, traded with the Turkish company and had a contract with the Russian\nministry of defense in 2023.\nTo illustrate the extent of Bondarenko’s connections in Russia, one of Business\nManagement trading partners is Ksenon (Moscow). Its owner, Sergey Goroshkov,\nshares the surname and a residential address with Sofia Goroshkova, who is a\ndirector of Business Management.\nRare gas production in the so-called DNR\nTechnicheskiye materialy was registered in July 2022 in Mariupol on the\npremises of Ingas, which is another rare gas manufacturer who fled the\noccupation and moved their production to Odesa. Technisheskiye materialy has\ntwo owners: Stanislav Komarovsky, originally from Mariupol and with 30 years\nof experience at Azovstal, and Alash Dadashov, a Chechenian who formerly\nserved as director of the Akhmat club in Moscow, directly associated with\nRamzan Kadyrov.\nIn January 2024, the company's website published information regarding the\nresumption of production, along with a job posting. In the video posted by the\nDNR government in December 2023, Stanislav Komarovsky stated that they sent\ntheir production to the Bauman Moscow State Technical University for research\npurposes7\n. Since Vitaly Bondarenko’s faculty specializes in rare gases, it is highly\nprobable that they were a recipient of the production of Tekhnicheskiye materialy.\nDiagram of the investigation showing the probable connection chain:\nIn July 2024, the Ukrainian ASSET RECOVERY AND MANAGEMENT AGENCY\nannounced a competition for a manager position for the assets and corporate\nrights of Cryoin Engineering, as well as the seized property of its actual owners.\nWe are still awaiting the final decision.\nConclusion\nFrom our findings, it seems highly plausible that this sanctions evasion scheme\nand the actors involved in it were recently active in the regions and businesses\nmentioned in our report. We are also confident of the likelihood of their\nconnections to the Russian government. Therefore, we assert that it is crucial to\ninvestigate this scheme further. Specifically, it is imperative to investigate any and\nall EU-based entities and their connections to this scheme and/or its actors.We\nencourage both official accountability groups and civil society to use the\n7 According to the company’s website, another buyer of Tekhnicheskiye materialy is Roscosmos\n(Russian aerospace agency). Roscosmos particularly needs xenon and krypton, which are used as fuel\nfor rockets. In December 2022, a shortage of xenon was reported, which was a problem for the realization\nof the Sfera state project. Sfera launches small satellites, which can be used for military purposes, among\nother things (More on military space programs 1, more on military space programs 2). Just as neon,\nkrypton and xenon are areas of specialization and interest of Bondarenko’s faculty at Bauman Moscow\nState Technical University, which also participates in the Sfera project. In March 2023, it was reported that\nRussia’s first krypton-powered satellite was launched.\ninformation uncovered by OSINT FOR UKRAINE to look deeper into this\nscheme.\nRare gases are a key resource for a global semiconductor production leading\ninnovation in various spheres, including military technology. Russia’s control over\nthe captured areas with natural resources combined with the possibility to utilize\nits existing production chains enables it to support its war machine, leading to\nserious implications for global safety. Therefore, it is crucial that this sanctions\nevasion scheme is brought to the attention of accountability bodies and\ninvestigated further.\nFor more details, users with a registered account in Aleph can view a full timeline\nin the OFU project through this link.",

In 2022, both companies and their owners were prosecuted\nin Ukraine, revealing a network of Cypriot and Turkish entities used to bypass\ntrade restrictions. Despite these legal actions, the companies have relocated\ntheir operations to Romania, resuming inert gas production.\nThe report begins by detailing the importance of rare gases and the roles Ukraine\nand Russia historically played in the global market. It then covers the sanctioned\ntrade practices under investigation and concludes with an analysis of a newer,\npreviously unexamined scheme.\nHow the war disrupted the rare gases market\nRare gases, or noble gases, include helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and\nradon. These inert gases are chemically stable and resistant to reactions, making\nthem ideal for preserving goods and manufacturing sensitive materials like\nsemiconductors and lasers. Neon, krypton, and xenon are especially crucial in\nglobal trade and the primary focus of this investigation. Neon is vital for\nsemiconductors and microchips, which have applications in various sectors,\nincluding the military. Krypton and xenon also play significant roles in aerospace\nindustries.\nBefore the full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia were major players in the rare\ngases market. Ukraine produced a substantial portion of the world’s neon and\nkrypton, while Russia was a significant producer as well. The two countries’\ninterdependent supply chain was rooted in Soviet-era practices, relying on\nlarge-scale cryogenic separation and fractional distillation processes to extract\ngases from air. Russian steel manufacturers provided raw gases, which were\nthen refined in Ukraine.\nUkraine’s historical industrial base, particularly older steel mills, supported the\nproduction of noble gases. This infrastructure, a legacy of Soviet manufacturing,\nwas initially geared toward military applications, including the development of\nhigh-powered lasers and missiles. Ukrainian companies such as Cryoin\nEngineering and Ingas were vital not only to Russian industries but also to\ninternational markets.\nUkraine accounted for around 70% of global neon production and approximately\n40% of krypton. It also produced 90% of the semiconductor-grade neon used in\nU.S. industries, crucial for chip manufacturing and laser technologies. Major\ncompanies such as Cryoin Engineering and Ingas produced thousands of cubic\nmeters of these gases monthly. In contrast, while Russia had its own production\ncapabilities, its output was not as heavily emphasized in the global market as\nUkraine’s.\nThe war has severely disrupted this supply chain. Neon, a byproduct of heavy\nsteel production in the Donbas region, has become a critical concern.The\nongoing conflict has transformed this area into a war zone, marked by continuous\nshelling and Russian occupation.\nIn the wake of the conflict, trade bans were implemented. Taiwanese companies\nhalted neon exports to Russia and Belarus, while Russia restricted neon exports\nto “unfriendly” countries. This sparked initial panic in the neon market, given its\nvital role in microchip production. Although prices have since stabilized, Chinese\nand Korean companies have gained a larger share of the market. Xenon and\nkrypton have also attracted greater attention, particularly xenon, which is crucial\nfor spacecraft fuel—an area of significant interest for Russia.\nMilitary use of rare gases in Russia\nRare gases play a strategic role in military applications. Neon powers\nhigh-intensity lasers used in targeting systems and range finders, while its\nhigh-voltage indicators assist in monitoring military equipment. Krypton is used in\nspecialized vehicle and aircraft lighting to aid visibility during operations and is\nemployed in precision targeting systems. Krypton isotopes are also used to\ndetect clandestine nuclear activities, providing critical intelligence.\nXenon is essential for ion thrusters in spacecraft, making it crucial for military\nsatellites and UAVs. Its properties are also ideal for searchlights and other\nillumination systems used in military operations. Both xenon and krypton are\nintegral to laser technologies, enabling various military functions and contributing\nto the production of small satellites with potential military applications.\nThe war has highlighted the strategic importance of noble gases in modern\nwarfare, as countries secure supply chains against disruptions. Russia’s\ndependence on rare gases continues to evolve in response to interruptions in\nsupplies from Ukraine. The current demand for neon, krypton, and xenon reflects\nboth military and industrial needs, set against the backdrop of increasing\ninternational sanctions and shifting global supply pressures.\nTo mitigate shortages and safeguard national security, Russia has pivoted toward\ngreater self-sufficiency in rare gases. As global demand increases, Russia’s\nposition as a supplier may evolve, especially as it strengthens relationships with\nnon-Western countries while navigating complex geopolitical challenges.\nHowever, obtaining reliable procurement data has become more difficult due to\nRussian government restrictions on public access to information regarding critical\ngoods, including xenon and krypton.\nCase study: Cryoin Engineering\nProsecution history\nAccording to the official prosecution that formally started on 16 September 2022\n(court document), Cryoin Engineering had been evading sanctions imposed\nsince the beginning of war. In 2022, Cryoin Engineering imported rare gases to\ntheir long-standing partner in Russia, Business Management LLC, for the sum\nof approximately 1 million US dollars (court document). As noted by the\nprosecution, Business Management supplied rare gases to the manufacturers\nthat belong to the Russian military sector\n1\n.\n● There were not only business connections between Cryoin Engineering\nand Business Management. One of the owners of the former is Larisa\nBondarenko2\n, and the owner of the latter is Vitaly Bondarenko, who is\nher father. Originally from Odesa, he, just as his daughter, holds a Russian\npassport and has been working as the head of the cryogenic engineering\nfaculty of the Bauman Moscow State Technical University. He has been a\nwell-known figure both in Moscow, which we elaborate on in Section 3, and\n2 According to the registry data and court documents, Larisa Bondarenko was an ultimate beneficiary of Cryoin\nEngineering from 23 June 2016 to 06 June 2022.\n1 According to the information available, it happened before the war; however, the official data may not be very\naccurate, and in April 2024, the Russian government forbade disclosure of procurement information on strategic\nresources, including rare gases.\nOdesa, and he is an influential academic in his field. As Section 2 will\nshow, all key companies in the sanctions evasion scheme are connected\nto Vitaly Bondarenko, albeit in different manners.\nTo evade sanctions, Cryoin Engineering used a Turkish company, HE 24 ME\nGAZ (Turkey). As the official prosecution states, on 30 March 2022, the\nparticipants of the above-mentioned criminal scheme (Cryoin Engineering,\nBusiness Management) established the company as an intermediary, which\nhelped evade sanctions (court document; trading data).\nAnother actor in the scheme is SG Special Gas Trading (Cyprus), an offshore\ncompany which is also an ultimate beneficiary of Cryoin Engineering. They\nparticipated in shipments and handled financial transactions. Below you can find\nan illustration of this sanctions evasion scheme.\nLooking for workarounds\nWhile the prosecution has been underway since at least September 2022 and\nthe property arrest was issued in February 2023, Cryoin Engineering continued\nto trade with the Netherlands, USA, Germany, Poland, and other countries in\n2022 and 2023. The latest record of Cryoin Engineering trading is from 15\nSeptember 2023. (See trading data). The latest record of HE24 ME GAZ trading\nis from 27 December 2023.\nHowever, they also began to explore new routes and establish new companies.\nOn 30 June 2023, the Cryoin Europe company was founded in Romania. It has\nbeen trading with two companies: a newly-formed Rem-Profi-Komplekt from\nOdesa (see trading data) and another Romanian company, Criomec, which was\nfounded 1994.\nOn a diagram below, new companies introduced in this part, which were not\nmentioned in the official investigation, are colored in green.\nThe owner of Cryoin Europe is Cryoin Holding, a Cypriot company that has the\nsame director as SG Special Gases. Her name is Elena Denisenko (also spelled\nNtenisenko). According to the official documents (view source, p. 64), the\nultimate owner of Cryoin Europe is Larisa Bondarenko (Cryoin Engineering).\nRemarkably, Rem-Profi-Komplekt and Cryoin Europe were incorporated just as\nthe court decisions against Cryoin Engineering and SG Special Gases Trading\nwere rendered. Moreover, the court document from 11 April 2023 reveals that\nCryoin Engineering intended to relocate the equipment despite the confiscation\norder issued by authorities. If we examine the trading data between\nRem-Profi-Komplekt and Cryoin Europe, their trade actually started with\nequipment needed for rare gas production.\nAbove, you can find a fragment of the timeline that shows legal measures against\nCryoin Engineering and the incorporation of several companies in Ukraine and\nRomania.\nAccording to the trading data3\n, the only other trading partner of\nRem-Profi-Komplekt was Baytree Trading (Romanian company). This\ncompany was founded in November 2023 and also trades with Cryoin\nEngineering. It is owned by a Ukrainian national Petro Dalakov, who is a former\nstudent of Vitaly Bondarenko and a former employee of Iceblik (predecessor of\nCryoin Engineering4\n).\nAccording to Ukrainian court documents, Rem-Profi-Komplekt appealed to the\ncommercial court of the Odesa region with a claim against the Bulgarian\ncompany Baytree Trading LLC for the recovery of 509476.89 USD. Last\n4 Although the information is unconfirmed, our source in Ukraine stated that Iceblik (Odesa) was a joint\nventure by Vitaly Bondarenko and influential Russian businessmen close to the Kremlin. After a financial\ndisagreement, Bondarenko opted out and formed a new company, Cryoin Engineering, where he had\nmore control.\n3 It is notable how this data is presented on ImportGenius: BAYTREE TRADING LLC STR CALEA\nPRUTULUI NR 12800219 GALATI ROMANIA. We were not able to find a company with this name under\nthe given address. However, there is a Bulgarian company named Baytree Trading (more on it in the main\ntext), and the address coincides with the residence of the previously mentioned Criomec. The latter is a\nRomanian company that trades with Cryoin Europe and works on construction of its production site.\ndeliveries of inert gases dated 5 December 2023, 26 December 2023, and 30\nDecember 2023. Baytree Trading LLC reported the impossibility of making\npayments under the above-mentioned contract due to an unsatisfactory financial\nsituation. It also shows the connection between Ukrainian “new company”\nRem-Profi-Komplekt and old players, and it proves that Rem-Profi-Komplekt sells\ninert gases abroad.\nAnother Ukrainian company that has been trading with HE24 GAZ since July\n2023, is UU Invest (see this link). After 7 December 2022, it replaced Cryoin\nEngineering as a Ukrainian partner of HE24 GAZ who, in turn, traded with Russia\nuntil the very end of 2023.\nAccording to the Ukrainian court database, UU Invest was involved in cases\nconcerning the supply of substandard medical oxygen to hospitals during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. They were also indirectly involved in cases of “financing\nterrorism”.\nThe last actor we were able to identify in this sanctions evasion scheme is a\nJapanese company Iskra Industry Co. Ltd. It has traded with both Cryoin\nEngineering and Business Management since before the war began. Although\nIskra Industry Co. is a Japanese company established in 1960, it has been\nclosely linked to Russia for a long time; the company was founded with the goal\nof trading with the Soviet Union. Even today, Russia remains its main trading\npartner.\nRussian connections of Vitaly Bondarenko\nAs head of the cryogenic department of the Bauman Moscow State Technical\nUniversity, Vitaly Bondarenko has numerous connections with the Russian\nestablishment. His faculty took part in various large-scale governmental projects.\nIn July 2022, a facility for the production of pure neon was launched on behalf of\nthe Russian government on property of the Bauman Moscow State Technical\nUniversity. This was personally reported to Putin by Denis Manturov, Minister of\nIndustry and Trade, who was present at the opening.\nA more detailed scheme showing links found in the investigation:\nHowever, there is another set of Russian companies that are connected to\nBondarenko via the Turkish company HE24 ME GAZ, which, according to the\nUkrainian prosecution (see Section 1), was created with participation of Cryoin\nEngineering and Business Management to evade sanctions.\nRemarkably, it is very likely that HE24 ME GAZ is also connected with the\nRussian oligarchs.

He has been a\nwell-known figure both in Moscow, which we elaborate on in Section 3, and\n2 According to the registry data and court documents, Larisa Bondarenko was an ultimate beneficiary of Cryoin\nEngineering from 23 June 2016 to 06 June 2022.\n1 According to the information available, it happened before the war; however, the official data may not be very\naccurate, and in April 2024, the Russian government forbade disclosure of procurement information on strategic\nresources, including rare gases.\nOdesa, and he is an influential academic in his field. As Section 2 will\nshow, all key companies in the sanctions evasion scheme are connected\nto Vitaly Bondarenko, albeit in different manners.\nTo evade sanctions, Cryoin Engineering used a Turkish company, HE 24 ME\nGAZ (Turkey). As the official prosecution states, on 30 March 2022, the\nparticipants of the above-mentioned criminal scheme (Cryoin Engineering,\nBusiness Management) established the company as an intermediary, which\nhelped evade sanctions (court document; trading data).\nAnother actor in the scheme is SG Special Gas Trading (Cyprus), an offshore\ncompany which is also an ultimate beneficiary of Cryoin Engineering. They\nparticipated in shipments and handled financial transactions. Below you can find\nan illustration of this sanctions evasion scheme.\nLooking for workarounds\nWhile the prosecution has been underway since at least September 2022 and\nthe property arrest was issued in February 2023, Cryoin Engineering continued\nto trade with the Netherlands, USA, Germany, Poland, and other countries in\n2022 and 2023. The latest record of Cryoin Engineering trading is from 15\nSeptember 2023. (See trading data). The latest record of HE24 ME GAZ trading\nis from 27 December 2023.\nHowever, they also began to explore new routes and establish new companies.\nOn 30 June 2023, the Cryoin Europe company was founded in Romania. It has\nbeen trading with two companies: a newly-formed Rem-Profi-Komplekt from\nOdesa (see trading data) and another Romanian company, Criomec, which was\nfounded 1994.\nOn a diagram below, new companies introduced in this part, which were not\nmentioned in the official investigation, are colored in green.\nThe owner of Cryoin Europe is Cryoin Holding, a Cypriot company that has the\nsame director as SG Special Gases. Her name is Elena Denisenko (also spelled\nNtenisenko). According to the official documents (view source, p. 64), the\nultimate owner of Cryoin Europe is Larisa Bondarenko (Cryoin Engineering).\nRemarkably, Rem-Profi-Komplekt and Cryoin Europe were incorporated just as\nthe court decisions against Cryoin Engineering and SG Special Gases Trading\nwere rendered. Moreover, the court document from 11 April 2023 reveals that\nCryoin Engineering intended to relocate the equipment despite the confiscation\norder issued by authorities. If we examine the trading data between\nRem-Profi-Komplekt and Cryoin Europe, their trade actually started with\nequipment needed for rare gas production.\nAbove, you can find a fragment of the timeline that shows legal measures against\nCryoin Engineering and the incorporation of several companies in Ukraine and\nRomania.\nAccording to the trading data3\n, the only other trading partner of\nRem-Profi-Komplekt was Baytree Trading (Romanian company). This\ncompany was founded in November 2023 and also trades with Cryoin\nEngineering. It is owned by a Ukrainian national Petro Dalakov, who is a former\nstudent of Vitaly Bondarenko and a former employee of Iceblik (predecessor of\nCryoin Engineering4\n).\nAccording to Ukrainian court documents, Rem-Profi-Komplekt appealed to the\ncommercial court of the Odesa region with a claim against the Bulgarian\ncompany Baytree Trading LLC for the recovery of 509476.89 USD. Last\n4 Although the information is unconfirmed, our source in Ukraine stated that Iceblik (Odesa) was a joint\nventure by Vitaly Bondarenko and influential Russian businessmen close to the Kremlin. After a financial\ndisagreement, Bondarenko opted out and formed a new company, Cryoin Engineering, where he had\nmore control.\n3 It is notable how this data is presented on ImportGenius: BAYTREE TRADING LLC STR CALEA\nPRUTULUI NR 12800219 GALATI ROMANIA. We were not able to find a company with this name under\nthe given address. However, there is a Bulgarian company named Baytree Trading (more on it in the main\ntext), and the address coincides with the residence of the previously mentioned Criomec. The latter is a\nRomanian company that trades with Cryoin Europe and works on construction of its production site.\ndeliveries of inert gases dated 5 December 2023, 26 December 2023, and 30\nDecember 2023. Baytree Trading LLC reported the impossibility of making\npayments under the above-mentioned contract due to an unsatisfactory financial\nsituation. It also shows the connection between Ukrainian “new company”\nRem-Profi-Komplekt and old players, and it proves that Rem-Profi-Komplekt sells\ninert gases abroad.\nAnother Ukrainian company that has been trading with HE24 GAZ since July\n2023, is UU Invest (see this link). After 7 December 2022, it replaced Cryoin\nEngineering as a Ukrainian partner of HE24 GAZ who, in turn, traded with Russia\nuntil the very end of 2023.\nAccording to the Ukrainian court database, UU Invest was involved in cases\nconcerning the supply of substandard medical oxygen to hospitals during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. They were also indirectly involved in cases of “financing\nterrorism”.\nThe last actor we were able to identify in this sanctions evasion scheme is a\nJapanese company Iskra Industry Co. Ltd. It has traded with both Cryoin\nEngineering and Business Management since before the war began. Although\nIskra Industry Co. is a Japanese company established in 1960, it has been\nclosely linked to Russia for a long time; the company was founded with the goal\nof trading with the Soviet Union. Even today, Russia remains its main trading\npartner.\nRussian connections of Vitaly Bondarenko\nAs head of the cryogenic department of the Bauman Moscow State Technical\nUniversity, Vitaly Bondarenko has numerous connections with the Russian\nestablishment. His faculty took part in various large-scale governmental projects.\nIn July 2022, a facility for the production of pure neon was launched on behalf of\nthe Russian government on property of the Bauman Moscow State Technical\nUniversity. This was personally reported to Putin by Denis Manturov, Minister of\nIndustry and Trade, who was present at the opening.\nA more detailed scheme showing links found in the investigation:\nHowever, there is another set of Russian companies that are connected to\nBondarenko via the Turkish company HE24 ME GAZ, which, according to the\nUkrainian prosecution (see Section 1), was created with participation of Cryoin\nEngineering and Business Management to evade sanctions.\nRemarkably, it is very likely that HE24 ME GAZ is also connected with the\nRussian oligarchs. The registering person5 for the company’s website is\nAlexander Bazvanov. He is also a director of Tekhmed (LLC TechMed) and\none of the shareholders in DBB (more on this company below). HE24 ME GAZ\nwas a top buyer from Tekhmed in 2023 and 2022.\nTekhmed is under sanctions by Poland. The rationale for sanctioning was that the\ncompany “[..] has long-standing trade relations with Russian energy companies\nand Russian military departments6\n.

We encourage\nothers to verify and cross-reference our work.\nDisclaimer\nIntroduction\nThis report investigates how the Ukrainian company Cryoin Engineering and its\nRussian partner, Business Management, have evaded sanctions to continue their\ntrade in rare gases. In 2022, both companies and their owners were prosecuted\nin Ukraine, revealing a network of Cypriot and Turkish entities used to bypass\ntrade restrictions. Despite these legal actions, the companies have relocated\ntheir operations to Romania, resuming inert gas production.\nThe report begins by detailing the importance of rare gases and the roles Ukraine\nand Russia historically played in the global market. It then covers the sanctioned\ntrade practices under investigation and concludes with an analysis of a newer,\npreviously unexamined scheme.\nHow the war disrupted the rare gases market\nRare gases, or noble gases, include helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and\nradon. These inert gases are chemically stable and resistant to reactions, making\nthem ideal for preserving goods and manufacturing sensitive materials like\nsemiconductors and lasers. Neon, krypton, and xenon are especially crucial in\nglobal trade and the primary focus of this investigation. Neon is vital for\nsemiconductors and microchips, which have applications in various sectors,\nincluding the military. Krypton and xenon also play significant roles in aerospace\nindustries.\nBefore the full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia were major players in the rare\ngases market. Ukraine produced a substantial portion of the world’s neon and\nkrypton, while Russia was a significant producer as well. The two countries’\ninterdependent supply chain was rooted in Soviet-era practices, relying on\nlarge-scale cryogenic separation and fractional distillation processes to extract\ngases from air. Russian steel manufacturers provided raw gases, which were\nthen refined in Ukraine.\nUkraine’s historical industrial base, particularly older steel mills, supported the\nproduction of noble gases. This infrastructure, a legacy of Soviet manufacturing,\nwas initially geared toward military applications, including the development of\nhigh-powered lasers and missiles. Ukrainian companies such as Cryoin\nEngineering and Ingas were vital not only to Russian industries but also to\ninternational markets.\nUkraine accounted for around 70% of global neon production and approximately\n40% of krypton. It also produced 90% of the semiconductor-grade neon used in\nU.S. industries, crucial for chip manufacturing and laser technologies. Major\ncompanies such as Cryoin Engineering and Ingas produced thousands of cubic\nmeters of these gases monthly. In contrast, while Russia had its own production\ncapabilities, its output was not as heavily emphasized in the global market as\nUkraine’s.\nThe war has severely disrupted this supply chain. Neon, a byproduct of heavy\nsteel production in the Donbas region, has become a critical concern.The\nongoing conflict has transformed this area into a war zone, marked by continuous\nshelling and Russian occupation.\nIn the wake of the conflict, trade bans were implemented. Taiwanese companies\nhalted neon exports to Russia and Belarus, while Russia restricted neon exports\nto “unfriendly” countries. This sparked initial panic in the neon market, given its\nvital role in microchip production. Although prices have since stabilized, Chinese\nand Korean companies have gained a larger share of the market. Xenon and\nkrypton have also attracted greater attention, particularly xenon, which is crucial\nfor spacecraft fuel—an area of significant interest for Russia.\nMilitary use of rare gases in Russia\nRare gases play a strategic role in military applications. Neon powers\nhigh-intensity lasers used in targeting systems and range finders, while its\nhigh-voltage indicators assist in monitoring military equipment. Krypton is used in\nspecialized vehicle and aircraft lighting to aid visibility during operations and is\nemployed in precision targeting systems. Krypton isotopes are also used to\ndetect clandestine nuclear activities, providing critical intelligence.\nXenon is essential for ion thrusters in spacecraft, making it crucial for military\nsatellites and UAVs. Its properties are also ideal for searchlights and other\nillumination systems used in military operations. Both xenon and krypton are\nintegral to laser technologies, enabling various military functions and contributing\nto the production of small satellites with potential military applications.\nThe war has highlighted the strategic importance of noble gases in modern\nwarfare, as countries secure supply chains against disruptions. Russia’s\ndependence on rare gases continues to evolve in response to interruptions in\nsupplies from Ukraine. The current demand for neon, krypton, and xenon reflects\nboth military and industrial needs, set against the backdrop of increasing\ninternational sanctions and shifting global supply pressures.\nTo mitigate shortages and safeguard national security, Russia has pivoted toward\ngreater self-sufficiency in rare gases. As global demand increases, Russia’s\nposition as a supplier may evolve, especially as it strengthens relationships with\nnon-Western countries while navigating complex geopolitical challenges.\nHowever, obtaining reliable procurement data has become more difficult due to\nRussian government restrictions on public access to information regarding critical\ngoods, including xenon and krypton.\nCase study: Cryoin Engineering\nProsecution history\nAccording to the official prosecution that formally started on 16 September 2022\n(court document), Cryoin Engineering had been evading sanctions imposed\nsince the beginning of war. In 2022, Cryoin Engineering imported rare gases to\ntheir long-standing partner in Russia, Business Management LLC, for the sum\nof approximately 1 million US dollars (court document). As noted by the\nprosecution, Business Management supplied rare gases to the manufacturers\nthat belong to the Russian military sector\n1\n.\n● There were not only business connections between Cryoin Engineering\nand Business Management. One of the owners of the former is Larisa\nBondarenko2\n, and the owner of the latter is Vitaly Bondarenko, who is\nher father.

In 2022, both companies and their owners were prosecuted\nin Ukraine, revealing a network of Cypriot and Turkish entities used to bypass\ntrade restrictions. Despite these legal actions, the companies have relocated\ntheir operations to Romania, resuming inert gas production.\nThe report begins by detailing the importance of rare gases and the roles Ukraine\nand Russia historically played in the global market. It then covers the sanctioned\ntrade practices under investigation and concludes with an analysis of a newer,\npreviously unexamined scheme.\nHow the war disrupted the rare gases market\nRare gases, or noble gases, include helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and\nradon. These inert gases are chemically stable and resistant to reactions, making\nthem ideal for preserving goods and manufacturing sensitive materials like\nsemiconductors and lasers. Neon, krypton, and xenon are especially crucial in\nglobal trade and the primary focus of this investigation. Neon is vital for\nsemiconductors and microchips, which have applications in various sectors,\nincluding the military. Krypton and xenon also play significant roles in aerospace\nindustries.\nBefore the full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia were major players in the rare\ngases market. Ukraine produced a substantial portion of the world’s neon and\nkrypton, while Russia was a significant producer as well. The two countries’\ninterdependent supply chain was rooted in Soviet-era practices, relying on\nlarge-scale cryogenic separation and fractional distillation processes to extract\ngases from air. Russian steel manufacturers provided raw gases, which were\nthen refined in Ukraine.\nUkraine’s historical industrial base, particularly older steel mills, supported the\nproduction of noble gases. This infrastructure, a legacy of Soviet manufacturing,\nwas initially geared toward military applications, including the development of\nhigh-powered lasers and missiles. Ukrainian companies such as Cryoin\nEngineering and Ingas were vital not only to Russian industries but also to\ninternational markets.\nUkraine accounted for around 70% of global neon production and approximately\n40% of krypton. It also produced 90% of the semiconductor-grade neon used in\nU.S. industries, crucial for chip manufacturing and laser technologies. Major\ncompanies such as Cryoin Engineering and Ingas produced thousands of cubic\nmeters of these gases monthly. In contrast, while Russia had its own production\ncapabilities, its output was not as heavily emphasized in the global market as\nUkraine’s.\nThe war has severely disrupted this supply chain. Neon, a byproduct of heavy\nsteel production in the Donbas region, has become a critical concern.The\nongoing conflict has transformed this area into a war zone, marked by continuous\nshelling and Russian occupation.\nIn the wake of the conflict, trade bans were implemented. Taiwanese companies\nhalted neon exports to Russia and Belarus, while Russia restricted neon exports\nto “unfriendly” countries. This sparked initial panic in the neon market, given its\nvital role in microchip production. Although prices have since stabilized, Chinese\nand Korean companies have gained a larger share of the market. Xenon and\nkrypton have also attracted greater attention, particularly xenon, which is crucial\nfor spacecraft fuel—an area of significant interest for Russia.\nMilitary use of rare gases in Russia\nRare gases play a strategic role in military applications. Neon powers\nhigh-intensity lasers used in targeting systems and range finders, while its\nhigh-voltage indicators assist in monitoring military equipment. Krypton is used in\nspecialized vehicle and aircraft lighting to aid visibility during operations and is\nemployed in precision targeting systems. Krypton isotopes are also used to\ndetect clandestine nuclear activities, providing critical intelligence.\nXenon is essential for ion thrusters in spacecraft, making it crucial for military\nsatellites and UAVs. Its properties are also ideal for searchlights and other\nillumination systems used in military operations. Both xenon and krypton are\nintegral to laser technologies, enabling various military functions and contributing\nto the production of small satellites with potential military applications.\nThe war has highlighted the strategic importance of noble gases in modern\nwarfare, as countries secure supply chains against disruptions. Russia’s\ndependence on rare gases continues to evolve in response to interruptions in\nsupplies from Ukraine. The current demand for neon, krypton, and xenon reflects\nboth military and industrial needs, set against the backdrop of increasing\ninternational sanctions and shifting global supply pressures.\nTo mitigate shortages and safeguard national security, Russia has pivoted toward\ngreater self-sufficiency in rare gases. As global demand increases, Russia’s\nposition as a supplier may evolve, especially as it strengthens relationships with\nnon-Western countries while navigating complex geopolitical challenges.\nHowever, obtaining reliable procurement data has become more difficult due to\nRussian government restrictions on public access to information regarding critical\ngoods, including xenon and krypton.\nCase study: Cryoin Engineering\nProsecution history\nAccording to the official prosecution that formally started on 16 September 2022\n(court document), Cryoin Engineering had been evading sanctions imposed\nsince the beginning of war. In 2022, Cryoin Engineering imported rare gases to\ntheir long-standing partner in Russia, Business Management LLC, for the sum\nof approximately 1 million US dollars (court document). As noted by the\nprosecution, Business Management supplied rare gases to the manufacturers\nthat belong to the Russian military sector\n1\n.\n● There were not only business connections between Cryoin Engineering\nand Business Management. One of the owners of the former is Larisa\nBondarenko2\n, and the owner of the latter is Vitaly Bondarenko, who is\nher father. Originally from Odesa, he, just as his daughter, holds a Russian\npassport and has been working as the head of the cryogenic engineering\nfaculty of the Bauman Moscow State Technical University. He has been a\nwell-known figure both in Moscow, which we elaborate on in Section 3, and\n2 According to the registry data and court documents, Larisa Bondarenko was an ultimate beneficiary of Cryoin\nEngineering from 23 June 2016 to 06 June 2022.\n1 According to the information available, it happened before the war; however, the official data may not be very\naccurate, and in April 2024, the Russian government forbade disclosure of procurement information on strategic\nresources, including rare gases.\nOdesa, and he is an influential academic in his field. As Section 2 will\nshow, all key companies in the sanctions evasion scheme are connected\nto Vitaly Bondarenko, albeit in different manners.\nTo evade sanctions, Cryoin Engineering used a Turkish company, HE 24 ME\nGAZ (Turkey). As the official prosecution states, on 30 March 2022, the\nparticipants of the above-mentioned criminal scheme (Cryoin Engineering,\nBusiness Management) established the company as an intermediary, which\nhelped evade sanctions (court document; trading data).\nAnother actor in the scheme is SG Special Gas Trading (Cyprus), an offshore\ncompany which is also an ultimate beneficiary of Cryoin Engineering. They\nparticipated in shipments and handled financial transactions. Below you can find\nan illustration of this sanctions evasion scheme.\nLooking for workarounds\nWhile the prosecution has been underway since at least September 2022 and\nthe property arrest was issued in February 2023, Cryoin Engineering continued\nto trade with the Netherlands, USA, Germany, Poland, and other countries in\n2022 and 2023. The latest record of Cryoin Engineering trading is from 15\nSeptember 2023. (See trading data). The latest record of HE24 ME GAZ trading\nis from 27 December 2023.\nHowever, they also began to explore new routes and establish new companies.\nOn 30 June 2023, the Cryoin Europe company was founded in Romania. It has\nbeen trading with two companies: a newly-formed Rem-Profi-Komplekt from\nOdesa (see trading data) and another Romanian company, Criomec, which was\nfounded 1994.\nOn a diagram below, new companies introduced in this part, which were not\nmentioned in the official investigation, are colored in green.\nThe owner of Cryoin Europe is Cryoin Holding, a Cypriot company that has the\nsame director as SG Special Gases. Her name is Elena Denisenko (also spelled\nNtenisenko). According to the official documents (view source, p. 64), the\nultimate owner of Cryoin Europe is Larisa Bondarenko (Cryoin Engineering).\nRemarkably, Rem-Profi-Komplekt and Cryoin Europe were incorporated just as\nthe court decisions against Cryoin Engineering and SG Special Gases Trading\nwere rendered. Moreover, the court document from 11 April 2023 reveals that\nCryoin Engineering intended to relocate the equipment despite the confiscation\norder issued by authorities. If we examine the trading data between\nRem-Profi-Komplekt and Cryoin Europe, their trade actually started with\nequipment needed for rare gas production.\nAbove, you can find a fragment of the timeline that shows legal measures against\nCryoin Engineering and the incorporation of several companies in Ukraine and\nRomania.\nAccording to the trading data3\n, the only other trading partner of\nRem-Profi-Komplekt was Baytree Trading (Romanian company). This\ncompany was founded in November 2023 and also trades with Cryoin\nEngineering. It is owned by a Ukrainian national Petro Dalakov, who is a former\nstudent of Vitaly Bondarenko and a former employee of Iceblik (predecessor of\nCryoin Engineering4\n).\nAccording to Ukrainian court documents, Rem-Profi-Komplekt appealed to the\ncommercial court of the Odesa region with a claim against the Bulgarian\ncompany Baytree Trading LLC for the recovery of 509476.89 USD. Last\n4 Although the information is unconfirmed, our source in Ukraine stated that Iceblik (Odesa) was a joint\nventure by Vitaly Bondarenko and influential Russian businessmen close to the Kremlin. After a financial\ndisagreement, Bondarenko opted out and formed a new company, Cryoin Engineering, where he had\nmore control.\n3 It is notable how this data is presented on ImportGenius: BAYTREE TRADING LLC STR CALEA\nPRUTULUI NR 12800219 GALATI ROMANIA. We were not able to find a company with this name under\nthe given address. However, there is a Bulgarian company named Baytree Trading (more on it in the main\ntext), and the address coincides with the residence of the previously mentioned Criomec. The latter is a\nRomanian company that trades with Cryoin Europe and works on construction of its production site.\ndeliveries of inert gases dated 5 December 2023, 26 December 2023, and 30\nDecember 2023. Baytree Trading LLC reported the impossibility of making\npayments under the above-mentioned contract due to an unsatisfactory financial\nsituation. It also shows the connection between Ukrainian “new company”\nRem-Profi-Komplekt and old players, and it proves that Rem-Profi-Komplekt sells\ninert gases abroad.\nAnother Ukrainian company that has been trading with HE24 GAZ since July\n2023, is UU Invest (see this link). After 7 December 2022, it replaced Cryoin\nEngineering as a Ukrainian partner of HE24 GAZ who, in turn, traded with Russia\nuntil the very end of 2023.\nAccording to the Ukrainian court database, UU Invest was involved in cases\nconcerning the supply of substandard medical oxygen to hospitals during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. They were also indirectly involved in cases of “financing\nterrorism”.\nThe last actor we were able to identify in this sanctions evasion scheme is a\nJapanese company Iskra Industry Co. Ltd. It has traded with both Cryoin\nEngineering and Business Management since before the war began. Although\nIskra Industry Co. is a Japanese company established in 1960, it has been\nclosely linked to Russia for a long time; the company was founded with the goal\nof trading with the Soviet Union. Even today, Russia remains its main trading\npartner.\nRussian connections of Vitaly Bondarenko\nAs head of the cryogenic department of the Bauman Moscow State Technical\nUniversity, Vitaly Bondarenko has numerous connections with the Russian\nestablishment. His faculty took part in various large-scale governmental projects.\nIn July 2022, a facility for the production of pure neon was launched on behalf of\nthe Russian government on property of the Bauman Moscow State Technical\nUniversity. This was personally reported to Putin by Denis Manturov, Minister of\nIndustry and Trade, who was present at the opening.\nA more detailed scheme showing links found in the investigation:\nHowever, there is another set of Russian companies that are connected to\nBondarenko via the Turkish company HE24 ME GAZ, which, according to the\nUkrainian prosecution (see Section 1), was created with participation of Cryoin\nEngineering and Business Management to evade sanctions.\nRemarkably, it is very likely that HE24 ME GAZ is also connected with the\nRussian oligarchs. The registering person5 for the company’s website is\nAlexander Bazvanov. He is also a director of Tekhmed (LLC TechMed) and\none of the shareholders in DBB (more on this company below). HE24 ME GAZ\nwas a top buyer from Tekhmed in 2023 and 2022.\nTekhmed is under sanctions by Poland. The rationale for sanctioning was that the\ncompany “[..] has long-standing trade relations with Russian energy companies\nand Russian military departments6\n. One of TechMed’s key clients is the\nstate-owned Rosenergoatom – the operator of nuclear power plants in the\nRussian Federation, which is part of the state corporation Rosatom. The majority\nshareholder of TechMed – Andrey Dubovskov – until 2021 was among the\n6 You can see the list of Tekhmed’s trading buyers here: https://www.rusprofile.ru/id/6168752.\n5 Bazvanov has several other websites registered to him: raregaz.com and inertgaz.com. Both are\nregistered in Turkey and have an almost identical design. The role and activities of these companies are\nyet to be established.\ngroup of top managers associated with the Russian oligarch Vladimir\nYevtushenkov. TechMed is listed as a cooperating entity with the Ministry of\nDefense of the Russian Federation, to which it supplies specialized gases”\n(emphasis mine).\nTekhmed is not the only company associated with Andrey Dubovskov that has\nbeen trading with HE24 ME GAZ. Tekhnologiya, which is part of Dubovskov’s\nDBB LTD, traded with the Turkish company and had a contract with the Russian\nministry of defense in 2023.\nTo illustrate the extent of Bondarenko’s connections in Russia, one of Business\nManagement trading partners is Ksenon (Moscow). Its owner, Sergey Goroshkov,\nshares the surname and a residential address with Sofia Goroshkova, who is a\ndirector of Business Management.\nRare gas production in the so-called DNR\nTechnicheskiye materialy was registered in July 2022 in Mariupol on the\npremises of Ingas, which is another rare gas manufacturer who fled the\noccupation and moved their production to Odesa. Technisheskiye materialy has\ntwo owners: Stanislav Komarovsky, originally from Mariupol and with 30 years\nof experience at Azovstal, and Alash Dadashov, a Chechenian who formerly\nserved as director of the Akhmat club in Moscow, directly associated with\nRamzan Kadyrov.\nIn January 2024, the company's website published information regarding the\nresumption of production, along with a job posting. In the video posted by the\nDNR government in December 2023, Stanislav Komarovsky stated that they sent\ntheir production to the Bauman Moscow State Technical University for research\npurposes7\n. Since Vitaly Bondarenko’s faculty specializes in rare gases, it is highly\nprobable that they were a recipient of the production of Tekhnicheskiye materialy.\nDiagram of the investigation showing the probable connection chain:\nIn July 2024, the Ukrainian ASSET RECOVERY AND MANAGEMENT AGENCY\nannounced a competition for a manager position for the assets and corporate\nrights of Cryoin Engineering, as well as the seized property of its actual owners.\nWe are still awaiting the final decision.\nConclusion\nFrom our findings, it seems highly plausible that this sanctions evasion scheme\nand the actors involved in it were recently active in the regions and businesses\nmentioned in our report. We are also confident of the likelihood of their\nconnections to the Russian government. Therefore, we assert that it is crucial to\ninvestigate this scheme further. Specifically, it is imperative to investigate any and\nall EU-based entities and their connections to this scheme and/or its actors.We\nencourage both official accountability groups and civil society to use the\n7 According to the company’s website, another buyer of Tekhnicheskiye materialy is Roscosmos\n(Russian aerospace agency). Roscosmos particularly needs xenon and krypton, which are used as fuel\nfor rockets. In December 2022, a shortage of xenon was reported, which was a problem for the realization\nof the Sfera state project. Sfera launches small satellites, which can be used for military purposes, among\nother things (More on military space programs 1, more on military space programs 2). Just as neon,\nkrypton and xenon are areas of specialization and interest of Bondarenko’s faculty at Bauman Moscow\nState Technical University, which also participates in the Sfera project. In March 2023, it was reported that\nRussia’s first krypton-powered satellite was launched.\ninformation uncovered by OSINT FOR UKRAINE to look deeper into this\nscheme.\nRare gases are a key resource for a global semiconductor production leading\ninnovation in various spheres, including military technology. Russia’s control over\nthe captured areas with natural resources combined with the possibility to utilize\nits existing production chains enables it to support its war machine, leading to\nserious implications for global safety. Therefore, it is crucial that this sanctions\nevasion scheme is brought to the attention of accountability bodies and\ninvestigated further.\nFor more details, users with a registered account in Aleph can view a full timeline\nin the OFU project through this link.",

This was personally reported to Putin by Denis Manturov, Minister of\nIndustry and Trade, who was present at the opening.\nA more detailed scheme showing links found in the investigation:\nHowever, there is another set of Russian companies that are connected to\nBondarenko via the Turkish company HE24 ME GAZ, which, according to the\nUkrainian prosecution (see Section 1), was created with participation of Cryoin\nEngineering and Business Management to evade sanctions.\nRemarkably, it is very likely that HE24 ME GAZ is also connected with the\nRussian oligarchs. The registering person5 for the company’s website is\nAlexander Bazvanov. He is also a director of Tekhmed (LLC TechMed) and\none of the shareholders in DBB (more on this company below). HE24 ME GAZ\nwas a top buyer from Tekhmed in 2023 and 2022.\nTekhmed is under sanctions by Poland. The rationale for sanctioning was that the\ncompany “[..] has long-standing trade relations with Russian energy companies\nand Russian military departments6\n.

Tekhnologiya, which is part of Dubovskov’s\nDBB LTD, traded with the Turkish company and had a contract with the Russian\nministry of defense in 2023.\nTo illustrate the extent of Bondarenko’s connections in Russia, one of Business\nManagement trading partners is Ksenon (Moscow).

In 2022, both companies and their owners were prosecuted\nin Ukraine, revealing a network of Cypriot and Turkish entities used to bypass\ntrade restrictions. Despite these legal actions, the companies have relocated\ntheir operations to Romania, resuming inert gas production.\nThe report begins by detailing the importance of rare gases and the roles Ukraine\nand Russia historically played in the global market. It then covers the sanctioned\ntrade practices under investigation and concludes with an analysis of a newer,\npreviously unexamined scheme.\nHow the war disrupted the rare gases market\nRare gases, or noble gases, include helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and\nradon. These inert gases are chemically stable and resistant to reactions, making\nthem ideal for preserving goods and manufacturing sensitive materials like\nsemiconductors and lasers. Neon, krypton, and xenon are especially crucial in\nglobal trade and the primary focus of this investigation. Neon is vital for\nsemiconductors and microchips, which have applications in various sectors,\nincluding the military. Krypton and xenon also play significant roles in aerospace\nindustries.\nBefore the full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia were major players in the rare\ngases market. Ukraine produced a substantial portion of the world’s neon and\nkrypton, while Russia was a significant producer as well. The two countries’\ninterdependent supply chain was rooted in Soviet-era practices, relying on\nlarge-scale cryogenic separation and fractional distillation processes to extract\ngases from air. Russian steel manufacturers provided raw gases, which were\nthen refined in Ukraine.\nUkraine’s historical industrial base, particularly older steel mills, supported the\nproduction of noble gases. This infrastructure, a legacy of Soviet manufacturing,\nwas initially geared toward military applications, including the development of\nhigh-powered lasers and missiles. Ukrainian companies such as Cryoin\nEngineering and Ingas were vital not only to Russian industries but also to\ninternational markets.\nUkraine accounted for around 70% of global neon production and approximately\n40% of krypton. It also produced 90% of the semiconductor-grade neon used in\nU.S. industries, crucial for chip manufacturing and laser technologies. Major\ncompanies such as Cryoin Engineering and Ingas produced thousands of cubic\nmeters of these gases monthly. In contrast, while Russia had its own production\ncapabilities, its output was not as heavily emphasized in the global market as\nUkraine’s.\nThe war has severely disrupted this supply chain. Neon, a byproduct of heavy\nsteel production in the Donbas region, has become a critical concern.The\nongoing conflict has transformed this area into a war zone, marked by continuous\nshelling and Russian occupation.\nIn the wake of the conflict, trade bans were implemented. Taiwanese companies\nhalted neon exports to Russia and Belarus, while Russia restricted neon exports\nto “unfriendly” countries. This sparked initial panic in the neon market, given its\nvital role in microchip production. Although prices have since stabilized, Chinese\nand Korean companies have gained a larger share of the market. Xenon and\nkrypton have also attracted greater attention, particularly xenon, which is crucial\nfor spacecraft fuel—an area of significant interest for Russia.\nMilitary use of rare gases in Russia\nRare gases play a strategic role in military applications. Neon powers\nhigh-intensity lasers used in targeting systems and range finders, while its\nhigh-voltage indicators assist in monitoring military equipment. Krypton is used in\nspecialized vehicle and aircraft lighting to aid visibility during operations and is\nemployed in precision targeting systems. Krypton isotopes are also used to\ndetect clandestine nuclear activities, providing critical intelligence.\nXenon is essential for ion thrusters in spacecraft, making it crucial for military\nsatellites and UAVs. Its properties are also ideal for searchlights and other\nillumination systems used in military operations. Both xenon and krypton are\nintegral to laser technologies, enabling various military functions and contributing\nto the production of small satellites with potential military applications.\nThe war has highlighted the strategic importance of noble gases in modern\nwarfare, as countries secure supply chains against disruptions. Russia’s\ndependence on rare gases continues to evolve in response to interruptions in\nsupplies from Ukraine. The current demand for neon, krypton, and xenon reflects\nboth military and industrial needs, set against the backdrop of increasing\ninternational sanctions and shifting global supply pressures.\nTo mitigate shortages and safeguard national security, Russia has pivoted toward\ngreater self-sufficiency in rare gases. As global demand increases, Russia’s\nposition as a supplier may evolve, especially as it strengthens relationships with\nnon-Western countries while navigating complex geopolitical challenges.\nHowever, obtaining reliable procurement data has become more difficult due to\nRussian government restrictions on public access to information regarding critical\ngoods, including xenon and krypton.\nCase study: Cryoin Engineering\nProsecution history\nAccording to the official prosecution that formally started on 16 September 2022\n(court document), Cryoin Engineering had been evading sanctions imposed\nsince the beginning of war. In 2022, Cryoin Engineering imported rare gases to\ntheir long-standing partner in Russia, Business Management LLC, for the sum\nof approximately 1 million US dollars (court document). As noted by the\nprosecution, Business Management supplied rare gases to the manufacturers\nthat belong to the Russian military sector\n1\n.\n● There were not only business connections between Cryoin Engineering\nand Business Management. One of the owners of the former is Larisa\nBondarenko2\n, and the owner of the latter is Vitaly Bondarenko, who is\nher father. Originally from Odesa, he, just as his daughter, holds a Russian\npassport and has been working as the head of the cryogenic engineering\nfaculty of the Bauman Moscow State Technical University. He has been a\nwell-known figure both in Moscow, which we elaborate on in Section 3, and\n2 According to the registry data and court documents, Larisa Bondarenko was an ultimate beneficiary of Cryoin\nEngineering from 23 June 2016 to 06 June 2022.\n1 According to the information available, it happened before the war; however, the official data may not be very\naccurate, and in April 2024, the Russian government forbade disclosure of procurement information on strategic\nresources, including rare gases.\nOdesa, and he is an influential academic in his field. As Section 2 will\nshow, all key companies in the sanctions evasion scheme are connected\nto Vitaly Bondarenko, albeit in different manners.\nTo evade sanctions, Cryoin Engineering used a Turkish company, HE 24 ME\nGAZ (Turkey). As the official prosecution states, on 30 March 2022, the\nparticipants of the above-mentioned criminal scheme (Cryoin Engineering,\nBusiness Management) established the company as an intermediary, which\nhelped evade sanctions (court document; trading data).\nAnother actor in the scheme is SG Special Gas Trading (Cyprus), an offshore\ncompany which is also an ultimate beneficiary of Cryoin Engineering. They\nparticipated in shipments and handled financial transactions. Below you can find\nan illustration of this sanctions evasion scheme.\nLooking for workarounds\nWhile the prosecution has been underway since at least September 2022 and\nthe property arrest was issued in February 2023, Cryoin Engineering continued\nto trade with the Netherlands, USA, Germany, Poland, and other countries in\n2022 and 2023. The latest record of Cryoin Engineering trading is from 15\nSeptember 2023. (See trading data). The latest record of HE24 ME GAZ trading\nis from 27 December 2023.\nHowever, they also began to explore new routes and establish new companies.\nOn 30 June 2023, the Cryoin Europe company was founded in Romania. It has\nbeen trading with two companies: a newly-formed Rem-Profi-Komplekt from\nOdesa (see trading data) and another Romanian company, Criomec, which was\nfounded 1994.\nOn a diagram below, new companies introduced in this part, which were not\nmentioned in the official investigation, are colored in green.\nThe owner of Cryoin Europe is Cryoin Holding, a Cypriot company that has the\nsame director as SG Special Gases. Her name is Elena Denisenko (also spelled\nNtenisenko). According to the official documents (view source, p. 64), the\nultimate owner of Cryoin Europe is Larisa Bondarenko (Cryoin Engineering).\nRemarkably, Rem-Profi-Komplekt and Cryoin Europe were incorporated just as\nthe court decisions against Cryoin Engineering and SG Special Gases Trading\nwere rendered. Moreover, the court document from 11 April 2023 reveals that\nCryoin Engineering intended to relocate the equipment despite the confiscation\norder issued by authorities. If we examine the trading data between\nRem-Profi-Komplekt and Cryoin Europe, their trade actually started with\nequipment needed for rare gas production.\nAbove, you can find a fragment of the timeline that shows legal measures against\nCryoin Engineering and the incorporation of several companies in Ukraine and\nRomania.\nAccording to the trading data3\n, the only other trading partner of\nRem-Profi-Komplekt was Baytree Trading (Romanian company). This\ncompany was founded in November 2023 and also trades with Cryoin\nEngineering. It is owned by a Ukrainian national Petro Dalakov, who is a former\nstudent of Vitaly Bondarenko and a former employee of Iceblik (predecessor of\nCryoin Engineering4\n).\nAccording to Ukrainian court documents, Rem-Profi-Komplekt appealed to the\ncommercial court of the Odesa region with a claim against the Bulgarian\ncompany Baytree Trading LLC for the recovery of 509476.89 USD. Last\n4 Although the information is unconfirmed, our source in Ukraine stated that Iceblik (Odesa) was a joint\nventure by Vitaly Bondarenko and influential Russian businessmen close to the Kremlin. After a financial\ndisagreement, Bondarenko opted out and formed a new company, Cryoin Engineering, where he had\nmore control.\n3 It is notable how this data is presented on ImportGenius: BAYTREE TRADING LLC STR CALEA\nPRUTULUI NR 12800219 GALATI ROMANIA. We were not able to find a company with this name under\nthe given address. However, there is a Bulgarian company named Baytree Trading (more on it in the main\ntext), and the address coincides with the residence of the previously mentioned Criomec. The latter is a\nRomanian company that trades with Cryoin Europe and works on construction of its production site.\ndeliveries of inert gases dated 5 December 2023, 26 December 2023, and 30\nDecember 2023. Baytree Trading LLC reported the impossibility of making\npayments under the above-mentioned contract due to an unsatisfactory financial\nsituation. It also shows the connection between Ukrainian “new company”\nRem-Profi-Komplekt and old players, and it proves that Rem-Profi-Komplekt sells\ninert gases abroad.\nAnother Ukrainian company that has been trading with HE24 GAZ since July\n2023, is UU Invest (see this link). After 7 December 2022, it replaced Cryoin\nEngineering as a Ukrainian partner of HE24 GAZ who, in turn, traded with Russia\nuntil the very end of 2023.\nAccording to the Ukrainian court database, UU Invest was involved in cases\nconcerning the supply of substandard medical oxygen to hospitals during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. They were also indirectly involved in cases of “financing\nterrorism”.\nThe last actor we were able to identify in this sanctions evasion scheme is a\nJapanese company Iskra Industry Co. Ltd. It has traded with both Cryoin\nEngineering and Business Management since before the war began. Although\nIskra Industry Co. is a Japanese company established in 1960, it has been\nclosely linked to Russia for a long time; the company was founded with the goal\nof trading with the Soviet Union. Even today, Russia remains its main trading\npartner.\nRussian connections of Vitaly Bondarenko\nAs head of the cryogenic department of the Bauman Moscow State Technical\nUniversity, Vitaly Bondarenko has numerous connections with the Russian\nestablishment. His faculty took part in various large-scale governmental projects.\nIn July 2022, a facility for the production of pure neon was launched on behalf of\nthe Russian government on property of the Bauman Moscow State Technical\nUniversity. This was personally reported to Putin by Denis Manturov, Minister of\nIndustry and Trade, who was present at the opening.\nA more detailed scheme showing links found in the investigation:\nHowever, there is another set of Russian companies that are connected to\nBondarenko via the Turkish company HE24 ME GAZ, which, according to the\nUkrainian prosecution (see Section 1), was created with participation of Cryoin\nEngineering and Business Management to evade sanctions.\nRemarkably, it is very likely that HE24 ME GAZ is also connected with the\nRussian oligarchs. The registering person5 for the company’s website is\nAlexander Bazvanov. He is also a director of Tekhmed (LLC TechMed) and\none of the shareholders in DBB (more on this company below). HE24 ME GAZ\nwas a top buyer from Tekhmed in 2023 and 2022.\nTekhmed is under sanctions by Poland. The rationale for sanctioning was that the\ncompany “[..] has long-standing trade relations with Russian energy companies\nand Russian military departments6\n. One of TechMed’s key clients is the\nstate-owned Rosenergoatom – the operator of nuclear power plants in the\nRussian Federation, which is part of the state corporation Rosatom.

Tekhnologiya, which is part of Dubovskov’s\nDBB LTD, traded with the Turkish company and had a contract with the Russian\nministry of defense in 2023.\nTo illustrate the extent of Bondarenko’s connections in Russia, one of Business\nManagement trading partners is Ksenon (Moscow). Its owner, Sergey Goroshkov,\nshares the surname and a residential address with Sofia Goroshkova, who is a\ndirector of Business Management.\nRare gas production in the so-called DNR\nTechnicheskiye materialy was registered in July 2022 in Mariupol on the\npremises of Ingas, which is another rare gas manufacturer who fled the\noccupation and moved their production to Odesa.

Note: verify current corporate structure from Gazprom’s official materials.\n- Core business lines: exploration and production of natural gas, pipeline transmission (including major export routes through Nord Stream and other pipelines), gas marketing and trading, and related energy businesses.\n- Geographic footprint: extensive involvement in Russia’s gas sector, with international export via pipelines and through subsidiaries/affiliates.\n- Notable governance or control attributes: widely described as state-controlled or closely aligned with Russian government policy; leadership often features senior government-connected executives.\n- Practical implications for risk: exposure to geopolitical risk, sanctions regimes, energy price cycles, and regulatory changes.\n\nProposed sources to populate a robust background:\n- Gazprom corporate site (official)\n  https://gazprom.ru (English content often at https://gazprom.ru/en/)\n- Gazprom annual reports and corporate governance materials (for structure and leadership)\n  https://gazprom.ru/investors/ (investor relations)\n- Market and industry analyses (to contextualize Gazprom’s role in global gas markets)\n  - Major financial news outlets (Reuters, Bloomberg)\n  - Industry analyses (International Energy Agency reports, BP Statistical Review)\n- Public press releases and corporate leadership announcements\n  - Gazprom press center (official feed)\n\n3) Media\n\nData status:\n- No media data provided in the input.\n- No quotes, articles, or press mentions from the supplied material.\n\nWhat a complete media section would include (to populate later from public sources):\n- Summary of notable media coverage in the last 3–5 years:\n  - Coverage of Gazprom’s export strategies, pipeline projects (e.g., Nord Stream 1/2-related developments), LNG initiatives, and international energy diplomacy.\n  - Reporting on sanctions-related news (designation of entities/individuals, export-control implications).\n  - Corporate governance and leadership changes.\n- Critical media narratives and potential biases to be aware of:\n  - State influence framing, energy-security narratives in various jurisdictions, and industry-specific reporting biases.\n- Relevant media sources (to link in the section):\n  - Reuters, Bloomberg, Financial Times, The Wall Street Journal, Interfax (Russian), Kommersant, and Gazprom’s own press releases.\n\nSources (media context, to be replaced with specific articles later)\n- Gazprom press center (official communications)\n  https://gazprom.ru/en/press/news/\n- Reuters coverage (example source; to be used when populating with specific articles)\n  https://www.reuters.com/companies/Gazprom\n- Bloomberg coverage (example source; to be used when populating with specific articles)\n  https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GAZP:MOS\n- Additional: official Gazprom market and trade press releases\n\n4) Risks\n\nData status:\n- No risk assessment data present in the input.\n\nGeneral risk considerations to flag for due diligence on Gazprom (to be populated with specifics once data sources are mined):\n- Sanctions and regulatory risk: exposure to sectoral, financial, and secondary sanctions across multiple jurisdictions; potential violations can trigger significant penalties.\n- Geopolitical risk: energy security politics, shifts in European energy policy, and Russia’s foreign policy actions affecting gas transit and pricing.\n- Counterparty risk: counterparties in long-term gas contracts, project financing, and international buyers; counterparty credit risk heightened by sanctions and macroeconomic volatility.\n- Operational risk: pipeline integrity, supply disruptions, maintenance of export capacity, and compliance with international trade controls.\n- Market risk: energy price volatility, currency exposure (rubles, USD), and demand-supply shifts in European and global gas markets.\n- Reputational risk: association with a state-controlled entity in a highly scrutinized sector; media and NGO monitoring.\n\nSuggested risk indicators and methods (to implement later with data access):\n- Cross-check designation lists against Gazprom entities to identify sanctioned affiliates.\n- Map contract counterparties to sanction exposure and export-control compliance requirements.\n- Monitor regulatory updates from major jurisdictions (US, EU, UK, Canada, Japan, Australia) for new measures impacting Gazprom.\n- Use news sentiment analysis around Gazprom-related projects and pipeline governance.\n\nSources (risk-management context)\n- U.S. OFAC and sanctions program pages (see above)\n- EU sanctions framework (see above)\n- Gazprom official communications (see Background/Media sections for context)\n\n5) Biography\n\nData status:\n- No personal identifiers or biographical data for individuals connected to Gazprom were provided in the input.\n\nWhat a robust biography section would include (to fill with official bios later):\n- Key executives and board members, their roles and history:\n  - Example names commonly cited in public records: Alexei Miller (CEO of Gazprom), Viktor Zubkov (board chair at various times; as of various years, linked to Russian government circles), Elena Burmistrova (Director, Gazprom Export) – verify current roles.\n- Career paths, education, and notable public statements or positions.\n- Cross-links to related entities (Gazprombank, Gazprom Neft, Gazprom Export) and their leadership.\n\nSources for biographies (to corroborate with official bios and filings)\n- Gazprom corporate governance pages (leadership bios)\n  https://gazprom.ru/en/investors/management/\n- Reuters, Bloomberg profiles (for cross-checks when populating with exact titles and dates)\n  https://www.reuters.com/companies/Gazprom\n  https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GAZP:MOS\n\n6) Activity\n\nData status:\n- No recent activity data was provided in the input.\n\nWhat to populate here (when data is retrieved):\n- Timeline of major corporate activities:\n  - Gas production volumes, export volumes, and pipeline operations\n  - Major investment projects (e.g., pipeline expansions, LNG initiatives)\n  - Corporate actions (acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures)\n  - Financial results and key performance metrics\n  - Public statements regarding sanctions, energy policy, and market strategy\n- Geographic footprint by project and contract\n- Litigation or regulatory inquiries (if any)\n\nSources (activity context)\n- Gazprom annual reports and press releases\n- Market data across energy industry outlets (Reuters, Bloomberg)\n- Official project pages (Gazprom subsidiaries and Nord Stream-related materials)\n\n7) Links to sources by section\n\n- Sanctions\n  - Official sanction portals (listed in the sanctions section): \n    https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions-programs\n    https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/office-of-foreign-assets-control-sanctions-programs-and-country-information\n    https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/sdn-list\n    https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/sanctions/ukraine-crisis/\n    https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/russia-sanctions\n    https://www.international.gc.ca/world-monde/international_relations-relations_internationales/sanctions/russia-ukraine.aspx?lang=eng\n    https://www.mofa.go.jp/press/release/press4_002412.html\n    https://www.dfat.gov.au/international-relations/security/sanctions/sanctions-russia\n\n- Background\n  - Gazprom official:\n    https://gazprom.ru\n    https://gazprom.ru/en/investors/\n\n- Media\n  - Gazprom press center:\n    https://gazprom.ru/en/press/news/\n  - Reuters (example coverage;

These focus on validating Gazprom’s structure, exposure, and potential sanctions risk, and on identifying key entities and people for enhanced due diligence.\n\n- Prioritize official sanctions data pull:\n  - Action: Retrieve the latest Gazprom-related designations across all major jurisdictions (US, EU, UK, Canada, Japan, Australia) and capture full texts, designation dates, and restrictions.\n  - Rationale: Sanctions status directly affects counterparties, financing, and export controls; critical for risk assessment.\n\n- Verify corporate leadership and governance:\n  - Action: Compile current leadership roster and board composition from Gazprom’s official materials and major financial information services (e.g., Reuters, Bloomberg) to map potential governance risk.\n  - People to verify (examples, to confirm current roles): Alexei Miller (CEO), Elena Burmistrova (Gazprom Export), Viktor Zubkov (board-related roles, if applicable).\n  - Rationale: Leadership ties to strategic decisions and regulatory risk; helps identify key individuals for enhanced monitoring.\n\n- Map core subsidiaries and affiliates:\n  - Action: Build an ownership/affiliate map of Gazprom Group (Gazprom Neft, Gazprom Export, Gazprombank, etc.) and assess each entity’s exposure to sanctions, export controls, and international financing.\n  - Rationale: Sanctions often target groups of entities; understanding the network reduces blind spots.\n\n- Track major projects and market exposure:\n  - Action: Identify long-term gas export contracts, pipeline projects (e.g., traditional export routes and any LNG initiatives), and international partnerships.\n  - Rationale: Operational risk and sanction risk are tightly linked to project governance and counterparty risk.\n\n- Establish a monitoring cadence:\n  - Action: Set up a quarterly monitoring framework for sanctions lists, official Gazprom disclosures, and major market developments.\n  - Rationale: Sanctions regimes evolve; timely updates are essential for due diligence.\n\n- Source consolidation:\n  - Action: Create a centralized dossier per jurisdiction with the full-text sanctions, designated entities, and relevant dates; maintain a master annex of all Gazprom-affiliated entities designated.\n  - Rationale: Enables fast risk decisions and audit trails for due diligence.\n\nIf you authorize, I can proceed to:\n- Retrieve and compile the current, full-text sanctions texts for Gazprom by jurisdiction (US, EU, UK, Canada, Japan, Australia, etc.), including designation dates, banned activities, and designated entities/individuals.\n- Populate the Background, Biography, Activity, Media, and Risks sections with verified facts from official Gazprom materials and reputable public sources, including links to every fact.\n\nEnd of report.\n\nNotes on the provided data\n- The sole input data about Gazprom is the query itself and an unsuccessful web-search attempt that returned a 401 error. No sanctions, background facts, or other specifics were provided in the dataset. The sanctions section, therefore, remains a placeholder pending extraction from official sources, as outlined above.\n\nWould you like me to fetch and incorporate the official, up-to-date sanctions texts for Gazprom from the jurisdictions listed (US, EU, UK, Canada, Japan, Australia) and then populate the Sanctions section with full texts and designated entities/individuals? If yes, I will proceed to pull and structure the information with precise references and links.\n\n🏷️ **Entities Created (7):**\n**Relationships Created:** 6",
