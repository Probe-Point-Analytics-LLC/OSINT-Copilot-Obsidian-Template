We have made sure our\nassertions, statements and claims are supported\nby adequate information that can be verified and\ncross-referenced by third parties. We encourage\nothers to verify and cross-reference our work.\nDisclaimer\nIntroduction\nThis report investigates how the Ukrainian company Cryoin Engineering and its\nRussian partner, Business Management, have evaded sanctions to continue their\ntrade in rare gases. In 2022, both companies and their owners were prosecuted\nin Ukraine, revealing a network of Cypriot and Turkish entities used to bypass\ntrade restrictions. Despite these legal actions, the companies have relocated\ntheir operations to Romania, resuming inert gas production.\nThe report begins by detailing the importance of rare gases and the roles Ukraine\nand Russia historically played in the global market. It then covers the sanctioned\ntrade practices under investigation and concludes with an analysis of a newer,\npreviously unexamined scheme.\nHow the war disrupted the rare gases market\nRare gases, or noble gases, include helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and\nradon. These inert gases are chemically stable and resistant to reactions, making\nthem ideal for preserving goods and manufacturing sensitive materials like\nsemiconductors and lasers. Neon, krypton, and xenon are especially crucial in\nglobal trade and the primary focus of this investigation. Neon is vital for\nsemiconductors and microchips, which have applications in various sectors,\nincluding the military. Krypton and xenon also play significant roles in aerospace\nindustries.\nBefore the full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia were major players in the rare\ngases market. Ukraine produced a substantial portion of the world’s neon and\nkrypton, while Russia was a significant producer as well. The two countries’\ninterdependent supply chain was rooted in Soviet-era practices, relying on\nlarge-scale cryogenic separation and fractional distillation processes to extract\ngases from air. Russian steel manufacturers provided raw gases, which were\nthen refined in Ukraine.\nUkraine’s historical industrial base, particularly older steel mills, supported the\nproduction of noble gases. This infrastructure, a legacy of Soviet manufacturing,\nwas initially geared toward military applications, including the development of\nhigh-powered lasers and missiles. Ukrainian companies such as Cryoin\nEngineering and Ingas were vital not only to Russian industries but also to\ninternational markets.\nUkraine accounted for around 70% of global neon production and approximately\n40% of krypton. It also produced 90% of the semiconductor-grade neon used in\nU.S. industries, crucial for chip manufacturing and laser technologies. Major\ncompanies such as Cryoin Engineering and Ingas produced thousands of cubic\nmeters of these gases monthly. In contrast, while Russia had its own production\ncapabilities, its output was not as heavily emphasized in the global market as\nUkraine’s.\nThe war has severely disrupted this supply chain. Neon, a byproduct of heavy\nsteel production in the Donbas region, has become a critical concern.The\nongoing conflict has transformed this area into a war zone, marked by continuous\nshelling and Russian occupation.\nIn the wake of the conflict, trade bans were implemented. Taiwanese companies\nhalted neon exports to Russia and Belarus, while Russia restricted neon exports\nto “unfriendly” countries. This sparked initial panic in the neon market, given its\nvital role in microchip production. Although prices have since stabilized, Chinese\nand Korean companies have gained a larger share of the market. Xenon and\nkrypton have also attracted greater attention, particularly xenon, which is crucial\nfor spacecraft fuel—an area of significant interest for Russia.\nMilitary use of rare gases in Russia\nRare gases play a strategic role in military applications. Neon powers\nhigh-intensity lasers used in targeting systems and range finders, while its\nhigh-voltage indicators assist in monitoring military equipment. Krypton is used in\nspecialized vehicle and aircraft lighting to aid visibility during operations and is\nemployed in precision targeting systems. Krypton isotopes are also used to\ndetect clandestine nuclear activities, providing critical intelligence.\nXenon is essential for ion thrusters in spacecraft, making it crucial for military\nsatellites and UAVs. Its properties are also ideal for searchlights and other\nillumination systems used in military operations. Both xenon and krypton are\nintegral to laser technologies, enabling various military functions and contributing\nto the production of small satellites with potential military applications.\nThe war has highlighted the strategic importance of noble gases in modern\nwarfare, as countries secure supply chains against disruptions. Russia’s\ndependence on rare gases continues to evolve in response to interruptions in\nsupplies from Ukraine. The current demand for neon, krypton, and xenon reflects\nboth military and industrial needs, set against the backdrop of increasing\ninternational sanctions and shifting global supply pressures.\nTo mitigate shortages and safeguard national security, Russia has pivoted toward\ngreater self-sufficiency in rare gases. As global demand increases, Russia’s\nposition as a supplier may evolve, especially as it strengthens relationships with\nnon-Western countries while navigating complex geopolitical challenges.\nHowever, obtaining reliable procurement data has become more difficult due to\nRussian government restrictions on public access to information regarding critical\ngoods, including xenon and krypton.\nCase study: Cryoin Engineering\nProsecution history\nAccording to the official prosecution that formally started on 16 September 2022\n(court document), Cryoin Engineering had been evading sanctions imposed\nsince the beginning of war. In 2022, Cryoin Engineering imported rare gases to\ntheir long-standing partner in Russia, Business Management LLC, for the sum\nof approximately 1 million US dollars (court document). As noted by the\nprosecution, Business Management supplied rare gases to the manufacturers\nthat belong to the Russian military sector\n1\n.\n● There were not only business connections between Cryoin Engineering\nand Business Management. One of the owners of the former is Larisa\nBondarenko2\n, and the owner of the latter is Vitaly Bondarenko, who is\nher father. Originally from Odesa, he, just as his daughter, holds a Russian\npassport and has been working as the head of the cryogenic engineering\nfaculty of the Bauman Moscow State Technical University. He has been a\nwell-known figure both in Moscow, which we elaborate on in Section 3, and\n2 According to the registry data and court documents, Larisa Bondarenko was an ultimate beneficiary of Cryoin\nEngineering from 23 June 2016 to 06 June 2022.\n1 According to the information available, it happened before the war; however, the official data may not be very\naccurate, and in April 2024, the Russian government forbade disclosure of procurement information on strategic\nresources, including rare gases.\nOdesa, and he is an influential academic in his field. As Section 2 will\nshow, all key companies in the sanctions evasion scheme are connected\nto Vitaly Bondarenko, albeit in different manners.\nTo evade sanctions, Cryoin Engineering used a Turkish company, HE 24 ME\nGAZ (Turkey). As the official prosecution states, on 30 March 2022, the\nparticipants of the above-mentioned criminal scheme (Cryoin Engineering,\nBusiness Management) established the company as an intermediary, which\nhelped evade sanctions (court document; trading data).\nAnother actor in the scheme is SG Special Gas Trading (Cyprus), an offshore\ncompany which is also an ultimate beneficiary of Cryoin Engineering. They\nparticipated in shipments and handled financial transactions. Below you can find\nan illustration of this sanctions evasion scheme.\nLooking for workarounds\nWhile the prosecution has been underway since at least September 2022 and\nthe property arrest was issued in February 2023, Cryoin Engineering continued\nto trade with the Netherlands, USA, Germany, Poland, and other countries in\n2022 and 2023. The latest record of Cryoin Engineering trading is from 15\nSeptember 2023. (See trading data). The latest record of HE24 ME GAZ trading\nis from 27 December 2023.\nHowever, they also began to explore new routes and establish new companies.\nOn 30 June 2023, the Cryoin Europe company was founded in Romania. It has\nbeen trading with two companies: a newly-formed Rem-Profi-Komplekt from\nOdesa (see trading data) and another Romanian company, Criomec, which was\nfounded 1994.\nOn a diagram below, new companies introduced in this part, which were not\nmentioned in the official investigation, are colored in green.\nThe owner of Cryoin Europe is Cryoin Holding, a Cypriot company that has the\nsame director as SG Special Gases. Her name is Elena Denisenko (also spelled\nNtenisenko). According to the official documents (view source, p. 64), the\nultimate owner of Cryoin Europe is Larisa Bondarenko (Cryoin Engineering).\nRemarkably, Rem-Profi-Komplekt and Cryoin Europe were incorporated just as\nthe court decisions against Cryoin Engineering and SG Special Gases Trading\nwere rendered. Moreover, the court document from 11 April 2023 reveals that\nCryoin Engineering intended to relocate the equipment despite the confiscation\norder issued by authorities. If we examine the trading data between\nRem-Profi-Komplekt and Cryoin Europe, their trade actually started with\nequipment needed for rare gas production.\nAbove, you can find a fragment of the timeline that shows legal measures against\nCryoin Engineering and the incorporation of several companies in Ukraine and\nRomania.\nAccording to the trading data3\n, the only other trading partner of\nRem-Profi-Komplekt was Baytree Trading (Romanian company). This\ncompany was founded in November 2023 and also trades with Cryoin\nEngineering. It is owned by a Ukrainian national Petro Dalakov, who is a former\nstudent of Vitaly Bondarenko and a former employee of Iceblik (predecessor of\nCryoin Engineering4\n).\nAccording to Ukrainian court documents, Rem-Profi-Komplekt appealed to the\ncommercial court of the Odesa region with a claim against the Bulgarian\ncompany Baytree Trading LLC for the recovery of 509476.89 USD. Last\n4 Although the information is unconfirmed, our source in Ukraine stated that Iceblik (Odesa) was a joint\nventure by Vitaly Bondarenko and influential Russian businessmen close to the Kremlin. After a financial\ndisagreement, Bondarenko opted out and formed a new company, Cryoin Engineering, where he had\nmore control.\n3 It is notable how this data is presented on ImportGenius: BAYTREE TRADING LLC STR CALEA\nPRUTULUI NR 12800219 GALATI ROMANIA. We were not able to find a company with this name under\nthe given address. However, there is a Bulgarian company named Baytree Trading (more on it in the main\ntext), and the address coincides with the residence of the previously mentioned Criomec. The latter is a\nRomanian company that trades with Cryoin Europe and works on construction of its production site.\ndeliveries of inert gases dated 5 December 2023, 26 December 2023, and 30\nDecember 2023. Baytree Trading LLC reported the impossibility of making\npayments under the above-mentioned contract due to an unsatisfactory financial\nsituation. It also shows the connection between Ukrainian “new company”\nRem-Profi-Komplekt and old players, and it proves that Rem-Profi-Komplekt sells\ninert gases abroad.\nAnother Ukrainian company that has been trading with HE24 GAZ since July\n2023, is UU Invest (see this link). After 7 December 2022, it replaced Cryoin\nEngineering as a Ukrainian partner of HE24 GAZ who, in turn, traded with Russia\nuntil the very end of 2023.\nAccording to the Ukrainian court database, UU Invest was involved in cases\nconcerning the supply of substandard medical oxygen to hospitals during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. They were also indirectly involved in cases of “financing\nterrorism”.\nThe last actor we were able to identify in this sanctions evasion scheme is a\nJapanese company Iskra Industry Co. Ltd. It has traded with both Cryoin\nEngineering and Business Management since before the war began. Although\nIskra Industry Co. is a Japanese company established in 1960, it has been\nclosely linked to Russia for a long time; the company was founded with the goal\nof trading with the Soviet Union. Even today, Russia remains its main trading\npartner.\nRussian connections of Vitaly Bondarenko\nAs head of the cryogenic department of the Bauman Moscow State Technical\nUniversity, Vitaly Bondarenko has numerous connections with the Russian\nestablishment. His faculty took part in various large-scale governmental projects.\nIn July 2022, a facility for the production of pure neon was launched on behalf of\nthe Russian government on property of the Bauman Moscow State Technical\nUniversity. This was personally reported to Putin by Denis Manturov, Minister of\nIndustry and Trade, who was present at the opening.\nA more detailed scheme showing links found in the investigation:\nHowever, there is another set of Russian companies that are connected to\nBondarenko via the Turkish company HE24 ME GAZ, which, according to the\nUkrainian prosecution (see Section 1), was created with participation of Cryoin\nEngineering and Business Management to evade sanctions.\nRemarkably, it is very likely that HE24 ME GAZ is also connected with the\nRussian oligarchs. The registering person5 for the company’s website is\nAlexander Bazvanov. He is also a director of Tekhmed (LLC TechMed) and\none of the shareholders in DBB (more on this company below). HE24 ME GAZ\nwas a top buyer from Tekhmed in 2023 and 2022.\nTekhmed is under sanctions by Poland. The rationale for sanctioning was that the\ncompany “[..] has long-standing trade relations with Russian energy companies\nand Russian military departments6\n. One of TechMed’s key clients is the\nstate-owned Rosenergoatom – the operator of nuclear power plants in the\nRussian Federation, which is part of the state corporation Rosatom. The majority\nshareholder of TechMed – Andrey Dubovskov – until 2021 was among the\n6 You can see the list of Tekhmed’s trading buyers here: https://www.rusprofile.ru/id/6168752.\n5 Bazvanov has several other websites registered to him: raregaz.com and inertgaz.com. Both are\nregistered in Turkey and have an almost identical design. The role and activities of these companies are\nyet to be established.\ngroup of top managers associated with the Russian oligarch Vladimir\nYevtushenkov. TechMed is listed as a cooperating entity with the Ministry of\nDefense of the Russian Federation, to which it supplies specialized gases”\n(emphasis mine).\nTekhmed is not the only company associated with Andrey Dubovskov that has\nbeen trading with HE24 ME GAZ. Tekhnologiya, which is part of Dubovskov’s\nDBB LTD, traded with the Turkish company and had a contract with the Russian\nministry of defense in 2023.\nTo illustrate the extent of Bondarenko’s connections in Russia, one of Business\nManagement trading partners is Ksenon (Moscow). Its owner, Sergey Goroshkov,\nshares the surname and a residential address with Sofia Goroshkova, who is a\ndirector of Business Management.\nRare gas production in the so-called DNR\nTechnicheskiye materialy was registered in July 2022 in Mariupol on the\npremises of Ingas, which is another rare gas manufacturer who fled the\noccupation and moved their production to Odesa. Technisheskiye materialy has\ntwo owners: Stanislav Komarovsky, originally from Mariupol and with 30 years\nof experience at Azovstal, and Alash Dadashov, a Chechenian who formerly\nserved as director of the Akhmat club in Moscow, directly associated with\nRamzan Kadyrov.\nIn January 2024, the company's website published information regarding the\nresumption of production, along with a job posting. In the video posted by the\nDNR government in December 2023, Stanislav Komarovsky stated that they sent\ntheir production to the Bauman Moscow State Technical University for research\npurposes7\n. Since Vitaly Bondarenko’s faculty specializes in rare gases, it is highly\nprobable that they were a recipient of the production of Tekhnicheskiye materialy.\nDiagram of the investigation showing the probable connection chain:\nIn July 2024, the Ukrainian ASSET RECOVERY AND MANAGEMENT AGENCY\nannounced a competition for a manager position for the assets and corporate\nrights of Cryoin Engineering, as well as the seized property of its actual owners.\nWe are still awaiting the final decision.\nConclusion\nFrom our findings, it seems highly plausible that this sanctions evasion scheme\nand the actors involved in it were recently active in the regions and businesses\nmentioned in our report. We are also confident of the likelihood of their\nconnections to the Russian government. Therefore, we assert that it is crucial to\ninvestigate this scheme further. Specifically, it is imperative to investigate any and\nall EU-based entities and their connections to this scheme and/or its actors.We\nencourage both official accountability groups and civil society to use the\n7 According to the company’s website, another buyer of Tekhnicheskiye materialy is Roscosmos\n(Russian aerospace agency). Roscosmos particularly needs xenon and krypton, which are used as fuel\nfor rockets. In December 2022, a shortage of xenon was reported, which was a problem for the realization\nof the Sfera state project. Sfera launches small satellites, which can be used for military purposes, among\nother things (More on military space programs 1, more on military space programs 2). Just as neon,\nkrypton and xenon are areas of specialization and interest of Bondarenko’s faculty at Bauman Moscow\nState Technical University, which also participates in the Sfera project. In March 2023, it was reported that\nRussia’s first krypton-powered satellite was launched.\ninformation uncovered by OSINT FOR UKRAINE to look deeper into this\nscheme.\nRare gases are a key resource for a global semiconductor production leading\ninnovation in various spheres, including military technology. Russia’s control over\nthe captured areas with natural resources combined with the possibility to utilize\nits existing production chains enables it to support its war machine, leading to\nserious implications for global safety. Therefore, it is crucial that this sanctions\nevasion scheme is brought to the attention of accountability bodies and\ninvestigated further.\nFor more details, users with a registered account in Aleph can view a full timeline\nin the OFU project through this link.",

His faculty took part in various large-scale governmental projects.\nIn July 2022, a facility for the production of pure neon was launched on behalf of\nthe Russian government on property of the Bauman Moscow State Technical\nUniversity. This was personally reported to Putin by Denis Manturov, Minister of\nIndustry and Trade, who was present at the opening.\nA more detailed scheme showing links found in the investigation:\nHowever, there is another set of Russian companies that are connected to\nBondarenko via the Turkish company HE24 ME GAZ, which, according to the\nUkrainian prosecution (see Section 1), was created with participation of Cryoin\nEngineering and Business Management to evade sanctions.\nRemarkably, it is very likely that HE24 ME GAZ is also connected with the\nRussian oligarchs. The registering person5 for the company’s website is\nAlexander Bazvanov. He is also a director of Tekhmed (LLC TechMed) and\none of the shareholders in DBB (more on this company below). HE24 ME GAZ\nwas a top buyer from Tekhmed in 2023 and 2022.\nTekhmed is under sanctions by Poland. The rationale for sanctioning was that the\ncompany “[..] has long-standing trade relations with Russian energy companies\nand Russian military departments6\n. One of TechMed’s key clients is the\nstate-owned Rosenergoatom – the operator of nuclear power plants in the\nRussian Federation, which is part of the state corporation Rosatom. The majority\nshareholder of TechMed – Andrey Dubovskov – until 2021 was among the\n6 You can see the list of Tekhmed’s trading buyers here: https://www.rusprofile.ru/id/6168752.\n5 Bazvanov has several other websites registered to him: raregaz.com and inertgaz.com. Both are\nregistered in Turkey and have an almost identical design. The role and activities of these companies are\nyet to be established.\ngroup of top managers associated with the Russian oligarch Vladimir\nYevtushenkov. TechMed is listed as a cooperating entity with the Ministry of\nDefense of the Russian Federation, to which it supplies specialized gases”\n(emphasis mine).\nTekhmed is not the only company associated with Andrey Dubovskov that has\nbeen trading with HE24 ME GAZ. Tekhnologiya, which is part of Dubovskov’s\nDBB LTD, traded with the Turkish company and had a contract with the Russian\nministry of defense in 2023.\nTo illustrate the extent of Bondarenko’s connections in Russia, one of Business\nManagement trading partners is Ksenon (Moscow). Its owner, Sergey Goroshkov,\nshares the surname and a residential address with Sofia Goroshkova, who is a\ndirector of Business Management.\nRare gas production in the so-called DNR\nTechnicheskiye materialy was registered in July 2022 in Mariupol on the\npremises of Ingas, which is another rare gas manufacturer who fled the\noccupation and moved their production to Odesa. Technisheskiye materialy has\ntwo owners: Stanislav Komarovsky, originally from Mariupol and with 30 years\nof experience at Azovstal, and Alash Dadashov, a Chechenian who formerly\nserved as director of the Akhmat club in Moscow, directly associated with\nRamzan Kadyrov.\nIn January 2024, the company's website published information regarding the\nresumption of production, along with a job posting. In the video posted by the\nDNR government in December 2023, Stanislav Komarovsky stated that they sent\ntheir production to the Bauman Moscow State Technical University for research\npurposes7\n. Since Vitaly Bondarenko’s faculty specializes in rare gases, it is highly\nprobable that they were a recipient of the production of Tekhnicheskiye materialy.\nDiagram of the investigation showing the probable connection chain:\nIn July 2024, the Ukrainian ASSET RECOVERY AND MANAGEMENT AGENCY\nannounced a competition for a manager position for the assets and corporate\nrights of Cryoin Engineering, as well as the seized property of its actual owners.\nWe are still awaiting the final decision.\nConclusion\nFrom our findings, it seems highly plausible that this sanctions evasion scheme\nand the actors involved in it were recently active in the regions and businesses\nmentioned in our report. We are also confident of the likelihood of their\nconnections to the Russian government. Therefore, we assert that it is crucial to\ninvestigate this scheme further. Specifically, it is imperative to investigate any and\nall EU-based entities and their connections to this scheme and/or its actors.We\nencourage both official accountability groups and civil society to use the\n7 According to the company’s website, another buyer of Tekhnicheskiye materialy is Roscosmos\n(Russian aerospace agency). Roscosmos particularly needs xenon and krypton, which are used as fuel\nfor rockets. In December 2022, a shortage of xenon was reported, which was a problem for the realization\nof the Sfera state project. Sfera launches small satellites, which can be used for military purposes, among\nother things (More on military space programs 1, more on military space programs 2). Just as neon,\nkrypton and xenon are areas of specialization and interest of Bondarenko’s faculty at Bauman Moscow\nState Technical University, which also participates in the Sfera project. In March 2023, it was reported that\nRussia’s first krypton-powered satellite was launched.\ninformation uncovered by OSINT FOR UKRAINE to look deeper into this\nscheme.\nRare gases are a key resource for a global semiconductor production leading\ninnovation in various spheres, including military technology. Russia’s control over\nthe captured areas with natural resources combined with the possibility to utilize\nits existing production chains enables it to support its war machine, leading to\nserious implications for global safety. Therefore, it is crucial that this sanctions\nevasion scheme is brought to the attention of accountability bodies and\ninvestigated further.\nFor more details, users with a registered account in Aleph can view a full timeline\nin the OFU project through this link.",
