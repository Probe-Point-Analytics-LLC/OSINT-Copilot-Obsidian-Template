Below is your full OSINT **Due Diligence & Anti‑Fraud Report** on **Wagner Group**, using **all database material**, **web‑search content**, and **AI_Tool output**.

No tool errors were encountered.

------------------------------------------------------------
OSINT DUE DILIGENCE REPORT  
Subject: **Wagner Group** (and similarly named entities)  
Prepared for: Compliance / AML / CFT / Risk  
------------------------------------------------------------

SECTION 1 — Executive Summary  
The term **Wagner Group** refers primarily to a **Russian state-supported private military entity (PMC)** established around 2014. It is associated with extensive **international sanctions**, **armed conflict involvement**, and **documented human rights abuses**. It operates through multiple aliases and shadow entities, many of which appear in official sanctions lists worldwide.

A separate corporate entity, **Wagner Group Inc** (with US and Czech address references), appears in some databases but does **not** show direct links to the Russian PMC. Due to identical naming, this entity poses **high false-positive risk** in compliance screening.

Given the volume of sanctions, reputational risk, documented atrocities, and the absence of legitimate business operations, the group and all aliases pose an **extreme compliance risk**.
