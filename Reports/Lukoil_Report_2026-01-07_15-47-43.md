A. UNITED STATES — OFAC SANCTIONS

- Measures:  
  *Lukoil is designated under U.S. sanctions as of October 2025 along with Rosneft.* The intention was to pressure the Russian government regarding the Ukraine conflict.

  - International business operations where U.S. nexus exists  

As a result:  
- Lukoil began planning to sell its non‑Russian assets.  
- Gunvor’s attempted acquisition of those assets was blocked after U.S. Treasury labeled Gunvor “the Kremlin’s puppet”.
