SECTION 2 — Sanctions Review (very detailed)  
----------------------------------------------------
Important: The databases contain a “sanctions” object, but do **not** include any specific country‑level sanction list, designation number, legal basis, or official sanctioning authority.  
The subject appears **flagged**, but **NO confirmed governmental sanctions text** is included in the data.  

However, **media reports** indicate **Ukrainian asset freeze in December 2025**, not yet confirmed as an official government sanctions list entry.

Detailed Findings:

A. Internal/API Sanctions Object  
The internal dataset lists the subject under a sanctions object with:  
• Name and aliases  
• Birth date  
• Citizenship  
• Profession  
• Wikidata ID: Q18540655  
But does **not** include:  
• Legal authority (US, EU, UK, CA, AU etc.)  
• Sanction program (e.g., SDN, EU CFSP, UK OFSI)  
• Executive order or case number  
• Full official sanction text  

Therefore:  
→ This is a **flag/alert**, not confirmed official sanctions status.

B. Ukraine (per open‑source news, NOT official sanction list)  
Media report (NewsMaker, December 2025):  
• Ukraine froze part of Gushan’s assets.  
• Context: Alleged supply of goods/services to Russian military‑industrial complex via affiliated companies.

This is an administrative freeze stemming from investigation, **not a listed international sanction**, unless later formalized (not confirmed by data).

Direct text summary from source:  
“Ukrainian authorities froze a significant part of Victor Gușan's assets after investigators found that affiliated companies supplied goods and services to Russia’s military-industrial enterprises.”

C. No evidence found of sanctions from:  
• United States (OFAC)  
• European Union (EU CFSP)  
• United Kingdom (OFSI)  
• Canada (SEMA)  
• Australia  
• UN

Conclusion:  
Based on collected data, **the subject is NOT confirmed on any major international sanctions list**, but is **flagged** due to:  
• Internal database risk classification  
• Ukrainian asset freeze of 2025

SECTION 3 — Political Exposure & POI Status  
----------------------------------------------------
Databases classify him as:  
• “POI” – person of interest  
• “role.rca” – risk category association  
• Related to Transnistrian political-economic sphere

Open‑source political ties:  
• Sheriff supports Obnovlenie (Renewal), the ruling Transnistrian political party.  
• Since 2020, Obnovlenie held 100% of seats in the Supreme Soviet.  
• This concentrates economic and political influence in Gushan’s hands.

Not a classical PEP (not a government official), but qualifies as:  
• De‑facto political influencer  
• Key financial actor in a disputed/unrecognized territory

• Ukrainian asset freeze in 2025 relating to alleged Russian military‑industrial cooperation.

• Complex multinational business footprint  
• Multi‑citizenship (Moldova, RU, UA, PMR) increases risk exposure
