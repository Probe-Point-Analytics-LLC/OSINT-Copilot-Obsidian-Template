SECTION 7 — RISK ANALYSIS  
----------------------------------------------------
Identified risks:

1. Insufficient Public Information (Medium)  
• API_Converter1 returned **zero** registry data, creating a gap in official filings across certain databases.  
• However, substantial verified open-source information shows company is operating, listed, and active.  

2. Exposure to Ukraine Operations (Operational Risk)  
• Primary production assets located in Ukraine expose the company to war-related disruptions.  

3. Legal Exposure (Low)  
• One civil case in Poland — not criminal or regulatory.  

4. Geopolitical Risk (Moderate)  
• CIS market involvement could expose the company to the risk landscape of the region.

SECTION 8 — SUMMARY OF FINDINGS  
----------------------------------------------------
• MLK Foods Public Company LTD is a legitimate, publicly traded dairy producer headquartered in Cyprus.  
• Lack of registry data appears to stem from API source limitations, not from any red flag.  
• No sanctions exist in any jurisdiction.  
• No political ties or PEP exposure.  
• One non‑criminal legal case in Poland.  
• Overall risk level: **Moderate**, driven mainly by limited database coverage and geopolitical exposures, not by misconduct indicators.
