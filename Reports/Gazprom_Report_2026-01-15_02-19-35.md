2. SANCTIONS (VERY DETAILED – ALL COUNTRIES)
=====================================================================

Gazprom is heavily sanctioned across multiple jurisdictions. Below is a breakdown **by country or sanctions authority**, including **full descriptions** where provided.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 UNITED STATES (OFAC)

Gazprom is listed under:  
• **US OFAC Sectoral Sanctions (SSI List)**  
• **Executive Order 13662 – Directive 4**  
• **Executive Order 14024 – Directive 3**

**Executive Order 13662, Directive 4**  
Prohibits the provision, exportation, or reexportation of goods, services (except financial services), or technology in support of:  
• exploration or production for deepwater, Arctic offshore, or shale projects that have the potential to produce oil in the Russian Federation.  
Gazprom is classified as a targeted entity under this directive due to its activities in the Russian energy sector.

**Executive Order 14024, Directive 3**  
Restricts all transactions involving “new debt of longer than 14 days maturity or new equity” of Gazprom. This effectively cuts off Western financing and investment.

**Additional U.S. Restrictions**  
• Gazprombank, a major subsidiary, was sanctioned in 2024 to limit Russia’s access to global financial systems.  
• Restrictions apply to technology transfers and energy‑sector collaboration.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2 EUROPEAN UNION

Gazprom is restricted under the EU’s Ukraine‑related sanctions regime, including:  
• Prohibitions on debt and equity transactions  
• Restrictions on certain dual‑use exports  
• Prohibitions on advanced energy‑sector technologies  
• Prohibitions on new investments in Russian state‑owned energy companies

**Poland** enforced specific sanctions:  
• Compulsory administration of Gazprom's stake in **EuRoPol Gaz S.A.**, effectively removing Gazprom’s control and subjecting its shares to state management under Polish sanctions law.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
2.7 SUMMARY OF SANCTIONS RISK LEVEL  
• **Highest Possible Risk – Global, Multi‑Jurisdictional Sanctions**  
• Inclusion on U.S. OFAC SSI list + EOs 13662/14024 is particularly severe  
• Broad EU/UK/Canada/Australia/New Zealand prohibitions  
• Sanctions affecting subsidiaries and associates (e.g., Gazprombank)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
3. POLITICAL EXPOSURE (PEP CHECK)
=====================================================================

Gazprom qualifies as a **high‑level PEP‑linked entity** due to:

• Majority state ownership by the Russian government  
• Direct strategic importance to Kremlin energy, economic and geopolitical policy  
• **Alexey Miller**, long-time CEO, is a close associate of **President Vladimir Putin**

This significantly increases AML, sanctions, corruption, and reputational risk.
