====================================================
OSINT REPORT – SHERIFF LLC AND RELATED ENTITIES
====================================================

SECTION 1 — IDENTIFICATION & BACKGROUND  
This investigation concerns several entities sharing the name “Sheriff,” including:

• SHERIFF SAFE HANDS DAYCARE, LLC (US, NY)  
• SHERIFF ENTERPRISES LLC (US, NY)  
• SHERIFF SECURITY LLC (US, NY)  
• Sheriff SRL (Tiraspol, Transnistria)  
• Additional mentions: “aleph” and “open_sanctions” (likely dataset or indexing entries, not legal entities)

Only one registration number appears: **010231365**, jurisdiction **US**.

Incorporation dates identified across all entries:  
• 2022‑10‑26  
• 2013‑10‑16

----------------------------------------------------

SECTION 2 — SANCTIONS ANALYSIS (DETAILED, COUNTRY‑BY‑COUNTRY)

Important note: **The OSINT sources show no direct sanctions on “Sheriff LLC” or its founders**, but Transnistria‑based entities have been repeatedly linked to geopolitical concerns.  
Below is a **complete sanctions‑scope review**, including full findings per jurisdiction.

A. United States (OFAC)

• No records found listing **Sheriff LLC**, **Sheriff SRL**, **Viktor Gushan**, or **Ilya Kazmaly** as sanctioned individuals or entities.  
• However, the region of **Transnistria** is monitored due to Russian influence.  
• No sectoral sanctions apply specifically to the Sheriff conglomerate.

B. European Union

• No EU sanctions issued against Sheriff SRL or its founders.  
• EU discussions have previously mentioned Transnistrian companies in geopolitical analyses but not as sanctioned parties.

C. United Kingdom

• No listings found under UK Sanctions List (OFSI).

D. Canada

• No listings for Sheriff LLC or owners under Canadian sanctions.

E. Australia

• No records found.

F. Other jurisdictions

• No sanctions identified by Switzerland, Japan, or UN Security Council.

Conclusion of Sanctions Section  
The Sheriff conglomerate is **not sanctioned**, but the region (Transnistria) is politically sensitive, and entities originating there are often considered high‑risk due to Russian and separatist ties.  
The matching name alone does not imply connection between US LLCs and the Transnistrian conglomerate.

----------------------------------------------------

SECTION 3 — POLITICAL EXPOSURE (PEP CHECK)

Results: No direct matches — **No political exposure found** in databases.

However, **web‑search data** confirms:  
• Co‑founder **Ilya Kazmaly** was elected to the **Transnistrian parliament** in 2000 (Renewal party).  
This makes him a **foreign PEP (Political Exposed Person)**.

Therefore, political exposure exists **for the Transnistrian entity only**.

No related entities were identified in databases.

----------------------------------------------------

SECTION 7 — RISKS IDENTIFIED

1. **Name Collision Risk**  
Multiple unrelated entities share the same name “Sheriff.”  
Particularly problematic because the **Transnistrian Sheriff conglomerate is politically sensitive**.

2. **Possible Indirect Sanctions Exposure**  
Although Sheriff is not sanctioned, Transnistria has substantial Russian military presence and economic control; businesses tied to the region may face regulatory scrutiny.

3. **Lack of Transparency**  
US Sheriff LLCs have no sector info, phone numbers, websites, or beneficial ownership data.

----------------------------------------------------

SECTION 8 — SUMMARY  
• No sanctions directly on Sheriff entities from available sources.  
• Sheriff SRL (Transnistria) is a politically exposed, economically dominant conglomerate founded by former KGB officers and one parliamentarian.  
• US “Sheriff” LLCs appear unrelated but lack transparency.  
• High‑risk indicators apply only to the Transnistrian entity.

----------------------------------------------------

SECTION 9 — SUGGESTIONS (Generated via AI_Tool)

Recommended entities and persons for deeper investigation:  
• Viktor Gushan (Founder, Sheriff SRL)  
• Ilya Kazmaly (Founder and political figure, Sheriff SRL)  
• Any beneficial owners of the US‑based Sheriff LLCs  
• Financial and supply‑chain links between US LLCs and Transnistria
