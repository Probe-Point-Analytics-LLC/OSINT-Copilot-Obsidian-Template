Below is the full multi‑section OSINT report on **Cryoin Engineering Ltd.**, integrating all database output, web-search data, and the AI_Tool results.

------------------------------------------------------------
OSINT REPORT  
Subject: **Cryoin Engineering Ltd. (Ukraine)**  
Date: 2026‑01‑15  
------------------------------------------------------------

SECTION 1 — GENERAL BACKGROUND  
Cryoin Engineering Ltd. is a Ukrainian company specializing in the production and global export of ultra‑high‑purity rare gases, including neon, helium, xenon, and krypton. According to its official website, it operates proprietary cryogenic technology and maintains extremely high purity standards (up to 99.9999%).

The company appears to be headquartered at:  
1-A Mytna Square, Odessa, 65026, Ukraine.

Its public-facing profile describes over 25 years of industry experience, a large scientific staff (3 Doctors of Science, 6 PhDs, 13 PhD candidates, and over 100 graduates), and ISO 9001:2015 certification for rare gas production.

However, database information highlights a parallel narrative: the company is believed to be controlled—formally or informally—by Russian nationals, notably **Vitaliy Bondarenko** and possibly his daughter **Larisa Bondarenko**. Available registry data is incomplete or missing, including incorporation date, addresses, and registration numbers.

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 2 — OWNERSHIP & CONTROL  
Database data indicates:

• **Vitaliy Bondarenko**  
  - Nationality: Russian  
  - Role: Founder and probable co-owner / controller  
  - Notes: Longstanding contacts with Russian authorities and Russian energy sector  

• **Larisa Bondarenko**  
  - Relationship: Daughter of Vitaliy Bondarenko  
  - Possible role: Indirect controller  

This ownership profile raises potential geopolitical, sanctions, and national-security concerns due to involvement of Russian nationals in a strategic industry (rare gases, including neon essential for semiconductor production).

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 3 — LEGAL & REGULATORY EVENTS  
• **Seizure by ARMA (Ukraine)**  
  In March 2025, the Ukrainian National Asset Recovery and Management Agency (ARMA) inspected and took control of Cryoin Engineering’s corporate rights and production assets.  
  Reason: Ownership attributed to Russian nationals.

• **Technology transfer to South Korea**  
  In June 2023, Cryoin established **Cryoin Korea**, interpreted by investigative media as possibly enabling transfer of ultra-pure neon production technology abroad.  
  Related reporting also mentions accusations that Cryoin may have—directly or indirectly—supplied rare gases to Russian military‑industrial complexes, though no judicial verdict is reported in available OSINT.

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 4 — SANCTIONS ANALYSIS  
Important: Data shows *no direct sanctions* against Cryoin Engineering Ltd. However, the company is linked to both:  
1. Russian nationals (Bondarenko family)  
2. A Russian trading counterpart (LLC Medstroj), appearing in sanctions‑related contexts.

Below is a detailed breakdown.

A. **Ukraine**  
• No listing found directly sanctioning Cryoin.  
• However, ARMA seizure of assets is based on laws regulating Russian-owned assets.  
• Not a sanctions list placement, but a state action triggered by national security involvement.

B. **EU**  
• No direct designation found.  
• Indirect risk: Beneficial owners’ potential connections to Russian authorities could subject the company to due diligence flags under EU sanctions compliance frameworks.

C. **USA (OFAC)**  
• No listing for Cryoin Engineering.  
• No listing for LLC Medstroj.  
• No listing for the Bondarenkos.  
• But transactions involving Russian nationals in strategic materials may attract enhanced due diligence under Russia‑related sanctions advisories.

D. **UK**  
• No direct sanctions.

E. **Other jurisdictions**  
• No sanctions identified in open datasets.

Important context: Cryoin appears in “sanctions‑topic” datasets due to relations with **LLC Medstroj**, a Russian industrialgas company sometimes flagged in risk databases because of customs data linking it to sensitive export profiles. This does *not* equal formal sanction.

Public reporting highlights:

• Accusations (not proven in court) of supplying neon or other rare gases to entities linked to Russia’s military-industrial complex post-2022 invasion.  
• Coverage of ARMA asset seizure in context of Ukrainian state policy targeting Russian-owned businesses.  
• Reporting on the relocation or expansion of production capability to Korea.  
• No political affiliations of the company directly found.

SECTION 8 — RISK ASSESSMENT  
A. **Sanctions Exposure Risk — Medium**  
• No direct sanctions, but clear indirect exposure via:  
  - Russian ownership  
  - Industrial gases trade with a Russian company  
  - National security‑related asset seizure by Ukraine  

B. **Geopolitical Risk — High**  
• Strategic industry (neon essential for semiconductor lasers).  
• Ownership by Russian nationals during heightened geopolitical tensions.  

C. **Legal Risk — High**  
• Ongoing state management of assets by ARMA.  
• Allegations of technology transfer and potential supply to adversarial defense sectors.

D. **Beneficial Ownership Transparency Risk — High**  
• Missing registry data.  
• Informal or opaque control via family members.

E. **Reputational Risk — High**  
• Media accusations of treason and military‑related supply chains.  
• International scrutiny on rare‑gas supply markets post‑2022.

SECTION 11 — SUGGESTIONS (via AI_Tool requirement)  

Below is a structured list of **persons and companies recommended for further OSINT investigation**, based strictly on red‑flags in the data:

Recommended individuals for deeper investigation:  
• Vitaliy Bondarenko — Russian national, owner/controller  
• Larisa Bondarenko — possible co-controller  
• Stanislav Petrov — ARMA official involved in asset management

Recommended companies for deeper investigation:  
• LLC Medstroj (Russia) — trading counterparty flagged in sanctions-topic datasets  
• Cryoin Korea — potential vehicle for technology transfer  
• Any supplier or buyer in the Russian industrial gases and defense-related chain (requires targeted follow‑up)

These recommendations align with risk indicators around beneficial ownership, geopolitical exposure, and cross-border trade involving sanctioned jurisdictions.
