SECTION 3 — SANCTIONS CHECK (DETAILED)  
----------------------------------------------------
Data from databases:  
Arne Pohl appears in the “aleph” and “open_sanctions” datasets, but **no explicit sanctions were listed**. These sources often include non‑sanction entries such as company registries, leaks, compliance datasets, and global watchlists.

Very important: Being *present* in aleph or open_sanctions DOES NOT imply sanctions.  
The databases merely indicate that the individual was found in their datasets, without any linked sanction text.

Full review of available data:  
• No EU sanctions found.  
• No UK OFSI sanctions found.  
• No UN sanctions found.  
• No US OFAC sanctions found.  
• No Canadian sanctions found.  
• No Australian sanctions found.  

Conclusion:  
**At this time, based on the provided data, the subject is NOT sanctioned in any jurisdiction.**  
Only a passive reference in two global OSINT datasets is noted.

SECTION 7 — RISKS & RED FLAGS  
----------------------------------------------------
Risk indicators identified:

1. Conflicting birth dates  
• 1987‑07‑03 vs. 1965‑05.  
Possible identity mix-up or record inconsistency.

2. Addresses in two countries (Germany & UK)  
• No explanation given.  
May be legitimate (residence + business), but requires verification.

3. Presence in aleph / open_sanctions datasets  
• Not an actual sanction.  
• But indicates that the individual appears in global transparency datasets.  
Could require enhanced due diligence depending on assignment.

4. Company insolvency (ArPoCo GmbH)  
• Indicates financial distress of at least one business entity managed by the individual.

No other legal, political, military, or security risks found.
