------------------------------------------------  
SECTION 2 — Sanctions Screening (Very Detailed)  
------------------------------------------------  

IMPORTANT: A sanctions object appears in the data, but **OpenSanctions ID is null**, and the linked page appears to be a **business registry profile**, not a sanctions listing. The presence of the term *OpenSanctions* in metadata often indicates that the dataset was checked, not that the person is sanctioned.

Below is a detailed breakdown by sanctions lists and jurisdictions.

=== 2.1 Russia (RU) Sanctions Lists ===  
No Russian sanctions (Rosfinmonitoring) entries identified.  
No entries in federal wanted lists or monitoring registries.

=== 2.2 United States (OFAC) Lists ===  
No entry found.  
No matches in:  
• SDN List  
• SSI List  
• CAPTA, NS-CMIC, FSE, or other OFAC programs  

=== 2.3 European Union Sanctions (EU Council Regulations) ===  
No match found in EU restrictive measures databases.

=== 2.4 United Kingdom Sanctions (UK HMT OFSI) ===  
No listing found.

=== 2.5 United Nations (UN Security Council Lists) ===  
No match found.

=== 2.6 Canada (SEMA), Australia, Switzerland, Japan ===  
No entries identified.

=== 2.7 OpenSanctions Mention ===  
The databases contain a record labelled:  
"scheme": "OpenSanctions"  
…but with:  
• id: null  
• URL points to: https://ogrn.site/… (a corporate/individual registry aggregator)

This means:  
• The dataset referencing OpenSanctions likely cross‑links identities to check against sanctions lists  
• There is **no evidence** that the individual is actually listed on OpenSanctions  
• The URL is **not** a sanctions entry  

Conclusion:  
**No verified sanctions found in any jurisdiction.**  
The OpenSanctions reference is a *false positive* due to incomplete metadata.

------------------------------------------------  
SECTION 6 — Risk Assessment  
------------------------------------------------  

Identified potential risks:

1. Presence of a sanctions object in the database  
• Although the OpenSanctions ID is null, any mismatch or metadata anomaly creates possible compliance noise  
• Requires manual verification  
• Final assessment: low risk, likely a false positive

2. Very limited biographical data  
• Missing date of birth, address, professional background  
• Low transparency can be a risk factor in due diligence contexts

No additional risks (fraud, legal cases, political exposure, corporate links) identified.

------------------------------------------------  
SECTION 7 — Overall Assessment  
------------------------------------------------  
Based on all available data:

• No sanctions found  
• No political exposure  
• No corporate affiliations  
• No media or reputational concerns identified  
• The digital identity is minimal, making verification difficult  
• Main risk stems from incomplete data, not from negative findings  

Conclusion:  
Currently **low-risk**, but with **high uncertainty** due to lack of verifiable background details.

------------------------------------------------  
SECTION 8 — Errors & Warnings  
------------------------------------------------  
AI_Tool returned a valid response and no technical errors occurred.  
No warnings to report.  

------------------------------------------------  
SECTION 9 — Suggestions (Generated via AI_Tool Requirement)  
------------------------------------------------  

Based on the absence of detailed background information, it is recommended to perform extended investigation on:

• **Companies**:  
– Any entities associated with INN 525602539701 (even historically)  
– Companies registered in Nizhny Novgorod region (typical INN prefix 5256) that may have indirect links

• **Persons**:  
– Individuals sharing the same surname and region in Russian corporate registries  
– Possible relatives appearing in the same registry clusters  
– Beneficial owners or founders appearing on ogrn.site in proximity to the profile  

These further checks may reveal indirect associations or hidden corporate links.
