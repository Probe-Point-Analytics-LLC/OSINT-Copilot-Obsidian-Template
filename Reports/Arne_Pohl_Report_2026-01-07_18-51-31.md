SECTION 8 — RISKS & RED FLAGS
----------------------------------------------------
Identified risks:

1. Conflicting identity data  
   • Two birthdates (1987 vs 1965) suggest either multiple individuals or unreliable data.  
   • Different geographies (Germany vs UK/NL) may reflect multiple persons with identical names.

2. Insufficient confirmatory identifiers  
   • No ID numbers, tax IDs, passport data available.

3. Lack of sanctions/PEP hits does not eliminate risk  
   • Identity ambiguity increases the risk of false negatives.

4. Addresses inconsistent with web‑verified location  
   • Databases show GB and NL association, while public records show Germany.

SECTION 9 — OVERALL ASSESSMENT
----------------------------------------------------
Based on all data collected:

• The German entrepreneur ("Profile C") appears legitimate with traceable corporate and professional history.  
• The UK/NL-linked data ("Profiles A and B") contain inconsistencies and lack corroborating information.  
• No sanctions or political exposure identified.  
• No adverse media found.  
• Main risk: potential confusion between multiple unrelated individuals named **Arne Pohl**.
