This high number of aliases indicates intentional obfuscation and operational compartmentalization.

----------------------------------------------------
SECTION 8 — CONCLUSION  
----------------------------------------------------
The Wagner Group is one of the highest‑risk entities globally.

Any form of engagement, directly or indirectly, poses severe regulatory, financial, and legal consequences.

----------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------
Entities recommended for deeper investigation:

Persons:  
• Yevgeny Prigozhin  
• Pavel Prigozhin  
• Vladimir Putin

• Africa Corps  
• Additional Russian MoD-linked logistics companies supporting Wagner operations
